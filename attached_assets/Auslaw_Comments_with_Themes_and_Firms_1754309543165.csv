Sea-Virus-6517,"I am a practitioner is WA looking to go to the bar. I don’t know many barristers in WA so I’m a bit lost on the process. I understand that you have there is no bar exam and you need two barristers to endorse you to go to the bar. I don’t know many barristers in WA so I think this will be difficult for me. Is there any way around this? Are the any barristers who I be able to discuss this with?
I also am considering moving interstate to go to VIC Bar or NSW Bar as I think there is more work there for me and I will have more oppurtunities there. The WA Bar seems small and I am concerned I may not be able to get much work in WA considering I don’t work currently work in litigation(although I am interested).

easyas1b3,"Hello,
Any suggestions on highly litigated areas of law that I can appear in court for that isn't debt recovery?
I current work in debt recovery and am loving the litigation aspect of being able to run my own cases and actually represent my clients in court, rather than briefing a barrister. Although, it's getting draining trying to take money from people already in debt, and dealing with self-reps who just dont understand (i cant blame them though).
I intend on going to the bar eventually, although i know that's a long way off.

Aggressive_Ad_7470,"I’m a first-year law student and am required to select four placement preferences for a Department of Infrastructure summer internship, one of which I will complete the internship in. There are various placements available, but I’ve assessed “Commonwealth infrastructure projects” and “legal & FOI” to offer the greatest potential utility. I’m having trouble deciding between them.
Although my interest is obviously subject to change, I have a preliminary aspiration to work in projects or energy & resources. Should I select the three available Commonwealth infrastructure project placements (Western Sydney Airport, High Speed Rail, etc.) as my first through third preferences and select the department’s legal & FOI division as my fourth preference? Or would I be better off with the opposite approach—selecting the specialised legal & FOI placement first, followed by the three Commonwealth infrastructure projects placements?
The above decision is predicated on the assumption that the division in which I complete my placement will make some difference to my clerkship/employment prospects (given my projects interest). I’d like to get opinions on this. What, if any, could be the future utility of completing an internship like this? Might that potential future utility be greater or lesser if I choose Commonwealth infrastructure projects over legal & FOI? When it comes time to apply for clerkships, how might either placement be looked upon? I presume that this internship would be viewed as minor. However, in my cover letters for firms with strong projects groups, such as Allens, KWM, and White & Case, could I present it as a core experience that proves my interest—and basic, predominantly non-legal experience—in that practice area?

UTS is regarded slightly better but they’re basically the same

UTS law student society holds more events than mq and they’re a bit more exciting w more variety (although this depends on the year)
MQ has a better campus
overall i think they’re both solid options (i’m a student not a lawyer so take with a grain of salt) but the students are pretty nice across both unis and they are well represented in top tier firms. you’ll need a better WAM than you would at USYD or UNSW but supposedly UTS/MQ marks more leniently anyway.

ndg175,"Hi all.
I am a first year law student and have recently been promoted from a legal assistant to a paralegal at my firm. I work in the area of family law. I was seeing if any more experienced solicitors or paralegals can help with an issue I'm having.
My firm operates on a fixed fee basis, in which we issue clients with a contract for a fixed amount and we then (as solicitors or paralegals) can bill only to that extent. I recently being the rookie overbilled for one of my matters and had to cut back, my boss checked in with me to see if I'm on target to hit my bills and I told her yes as I have a new file with around 1.5K i can bill for (my target is 3 hours per day, and a rate of $330 and I was only about 6 hours behind on bills).
Me and the solicitor (that is also new to the firm) hold a meeting with the client via google meets, now this solicitor is quite old-fashioned. It was a Friday which in our office is a casual dress day in which you don't have to dress formally. The first thing he says to me when I walk in his office is 'where is your collar' which was quite a surprise. In short he did not take a liking to me. After the consultation I insisted on drafting the pre action procedure letter which is standard procedure in family law. He said to me no need since we wont work on this file until Monday. I later discover he had written ( a very poor) what looked imitation of a letter that is meant to be sent out and didn't even settle it with a senior associate. This also simultaneously took away the billings I had planned for that file, and have now got my boss very unhappy with me for missing my bills.
For context all my other matters are dormant and are awaiting other party's to act so I literally had 0 other things to bill for.

The most obvious answer is considering working for a CLC or something. The downside is that it's easy to get burnt out with the workload, and with limited resources, you'll have to figure a lot of things out yourself without anyone necessarily telling you. This can mean that you won't learn how to do things the right way.
In private practice one of the challenging things is the lack of autonomy, but the trade off is that in a mid tier with govt work you're more likely to get decent training. If you take it as an opportunity to learn, once you hit SA, the level of autonomy you get as a lawyer in private practice is largely unmatched in professional services. If you develop your own client base, you can choose who you work for. There are a lot of NFPs and charities out there doing meaningful work which are in desperate need of good legal advice, given by well trained lawyers.

Never turn down any work.
Finish all work by the deadline, or if you don’t think you can, tell the person who gave you the work as soon as possible. Don’t be afraid to ask questions if you’re unsure of the task.
Be kind to all legal assistants and paralegals. They have more value to the business than you do.
This isn’t a 9-5 job. If you try and hand back work to your supervisors so you can go play sport or go out to dinner, don’t expect a grad offer.
Never correct a lawyer in front of a client or opposing counsel. Basically, just shut up in meetings altogether.
Dress professionally and conservatively, even on casual Fridays (if that’s a thing where you are) and at work events.
Go into the office as much as you can, ideally full time. You can’t learn as well from home and you won’t be as visible as the rest of your cohort.
Don’t create drama or get involved in other people’s drama. Just be nice to everyone.
Don’t put anything in an email or on Teams that you wouldn’t say to someone’s face. IT can read your emails and Teams messages.
Learn how your supervisors like to work. Ask them. If I have questions, do you prefer emails or calls or Teams messages? Or can I come speak to you in person if you’re not busy? Do you want this in a memo or an email? Or should I just come chat to you with my findings?
Write professionally and concisely. Don’t make repeated spelling or grammar errors. It leaves a really bad impression.
Don’t get pissed at work functions. Have one or two, then get on the soft drinks or the non-alcoholic beers.

It should be pretty obvious that directions from a SA or partner override anything from HR. The clerks are trying to impress the lawyers, not the HR team.

Try and get entry level experience (paralegal/legal assistant/law clerk) when studying if it is feasible for you. There are family law firms that I know of who do amazing work and who will be more than open to a cold call (email) from you explaining why you want to go into the family law industry and how keen you are to learn the ropes. The main reason for this is that they went into it for the same reason you are about too, so they will relate to you.
As an anecdotal example, I tried to get an entry level role at a family law firm and their website made it abundantly clear that their purpose was to help achieve family law solutions for disadvantaged women in terrible situations in my community. All of the lawyers there were women, most of them middle aged. They're well known as the go-to intimidating, competent advocates for women in my town, and the women who work there are probably a lot like you.
As such, perhaps my email came across to plainly as being from a privileged 20something guy looking for my foot in the door and they never responded to my email. Conversely, if they saw your email pop up in their inbox and you explained why you wanted to work in family and your life experience, they would be much more likely to write back to you and give you a chance, because you are exactly the kind of person that those lawyers want to work with. Hirers in my experience want people at their office who are like-minded and who they like.
My approach would be to try and get an entry level role at one of those firms whilst studying, and then once you graduate and get certified there will most likely be a seamless transition to becoming a solicitor at the firm you are already working at. It's the approach a lot of us take as younger lawyers-in-training and you are unlikely to be discriminated against on the basis of your age if you simply follow that path like the rest of us.
On the other hand, you are much more likely to encounter age-based discrimination if you believe that you can simply graduate from your law degree with no legal experience and immediately land a solicitor role. This is the case for all of us and you might encounter pushback if you think that your age will lower the barrier of entry for you.
It seems as if you have a really good heart. Many family law firms will prefer your profile to someone like me even if I could work at their firm for 20+ years, because you are passionate and in it for the right reasons. Best of luck and I hope it goes well for you:). If you'd like to DM me I can show you some of the firms I'm talking about. Once you take a look at their websites and the emphasis they place on being passionate about the issues, it might quell your fears a little bit. Family lawyers usually aren't in it for the money, they're in it to help people just like you want to do.

You know those suburban practices with 20ish lawyers, and on their website the top lawyers will have the title of 'Director'? I always wondered how much those people made. I know a few of them and they seem happy, and obviously this will vary from firm to firm, but do those partners/directors in the 'burbs make decent money?

don_homer,"Yes, they can make good money by the average persons’ standards, but it will never rival the money made by partners at mid and top tier firms.
A firm that employs 20 lawyers is actually a pretty large law firm and clearly a successful one too. The principals will make good money out of it. Like top 5% of income earners according to the ATO’s data.
Sole practitioners who either are the only lawyer or maybe employ 1 or 2 lawyers can still make a decent living, but not to the same extent as those at larger firms.
The way to make money in law is by what is known as ‘leverage’. Principals can only do so much work in a day by themselves, and clients won’t always pay their full hourly rate because the work isn’t complex enough to justify that. So, you employ more junior lawyers to do the majority of the work for you, and you only need to spend (ideally) a bit of your time checking their work. Instead of being able to work on 2 matters a day, using leverage, you can work on much more in a day and make more money.
You aim to charge out your lawyers to clients at a rate that returns a gross profit margin of about 60%. That is much easier to do when the lawyer is more junior, because they don’t get paid as much as senior lawyer. If you get your rates and leverage correct, the principals should take home about 40% of the firm’s revenue after taxes.
This obviously all depends on what practices are generating the firm’s revenue. Some practice areas like conveyancing, debt recovery and criminal law are quite low margin. The 60/40 figure will likely not hold true for firms focusing on those areas primarily or exclusively. Commercial litigation, corporate law, commercial property, insolvency, etc will return much better profit margins.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1goetju/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Practice Areas,

Independent_Berry_32,"Hello 👋
I’m a student who is getting to pick electives next year, and I was just floating a few ideas around and wanted to get some opinions on a few ideas I had/units. I’d really appreciate any tips or helpful comments:
Tax law (I have a financial background prior to studying so I wouldn’t be starting fresh) - is any tax law unit worth doing? I’m expecting a hard unit but most individuals and businesses need tax help
Intellectual property law - I would be potentially interested in agriculture or anything tech related but my school doesn’t offer a specific agriculture unit. A lot of my cohort like the whole AI thing but I don’t want to go into a unit that’s super popular or has a competitive glut when it comes to work.
Litigation related units - I think it’s a taster for something like a law clinic. But I am really interested in court work, did other people find this type of unit helpful or interesting?
Environment/international environment law - after doing a bit of digging online, I could see the link to agriculture but I don’t know anyone who has done this type of unit.
Anything related to health law or the NDIS
Law review - has anyone on here done law review or is this more of an American law school thing.
Thanks for any thoughts or things to think about before finalising electives!",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1goetju/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Offers & Rejections,

At least at my uni while the subject was obviously specialised, I found the skills of applying complex statutory regulatory frameworks to a fact scenario to be very transferable.
Only do international environmental law if you're very interested in the subject and international law and politics. It's a lot of soft law and policy analysis.
The law review subject I was less stressful than a conventional course but still took some thinking. If you get to edit academic articles, then it might be worth doing as that looks good on the CV for certain jobs (I've had multiple prospective employers ask me about it).

I'm a first year working in an area of litigation that is extremely quiet. Most weeks ill only have an aggregate of 1-2 full days worth of work. As such, ive been looking to move into a more suited practice area, namely commercial litigation.
By chance, I heard one of the commercial litigation lawyers are leaving, and there may be an opportunity for me to make a transfer.
Yet, upon talking with my boss, other lawyers, and co-workers, I've been told the Partner i'd be working under is a bit of a bully: he'll yell at you, expect you to work late, micro manage you, etc etc.
BUT I have also been told that if I can 'withstand' this, i'll come out the other side as a diamond compressed from coal, so to speak. Essentially, although he is a bully, he is an excellent litigator, and will help me excel as a lawyer.
I should also mention I want to be a barrister eventually, so I think that this experience may help hone my skills for this.
Has anyone also been at these cross-roads and willing to give some advice? Will any possible sacrifice of work/life balance and mental wellbeing be worth the training ill receive? Are there any coping methods that you all use (other than drinking) to cope with working with people like this? Is this the expectation of all senior management in litigation roles, everywhere? Or am i better off looking elsewhere?

doglaw101,"As a 2PQE working in commercial litigation but across 4-6 different partners at any one time, a bad partner is never worth putting up with.
Some of the hardest working, most talented and inspiring partners can also be the ones who are always kind, have time to mentor you, respect you as an individual, support your growth and gives you opportunities to challenge yourself safely.
You might think being thrown in the deep end and getting buried with work is the way to learn quickly and thrive, but it will lead to burn out, resentment, a drop in the quality of your work, and a lack of strategic and academic consideration when managing matters. This isn’t what you want in your first few years.
You deserve a partner who will spend time with you to walk through matters with you. They will come up with ideas and considerations you might not think of when you’re being overworked and pushed to hit unrealistic expectations.

Shouldn't complain, really. People are nice. I have enough to eat. I mostly don't work weekends. So much luckier than most people in this country, let alone this world. I'm from migrant and refugee stock, and the privilege of stability is not lost on me.
But I am bored. There is a meaning to what I do, but it doesn't feel like mine anymore. I've run out of challenges at my level, and I'm fighting to maintain interest. I have to work so much harder to focus, and I've lost that hunger I had to do well, and it's not a nice feeling.
I want to move on to a role that is more engaging, but I don't know where to go. I thought about moving back to a firm, but I hated billables and firm culture. If I move up where I am, I stop lawyering and start managing full-time. There are CLCs, but the pay cut is huge, and I wonder how many of them are horrifically exploitative (I worked in one at uni that was).

don_homer,"CU has the better rep and the better work in most areas. Particularly if you’re interested in government work. It has changed a lot in the last 10 years. The culture is still high performance, but much more collegiate now. I know a lot of the partners there and they’re genuinely lovely people (although there are also some who are awful). It’s easy to do matters with them in my space because they know their stuff and take a collaborative approach to negotiation.
Corrs is a great law firm with a lot of talented practitioners, but their culture is in trouble right now. They’re going through a large change management program in the partnership, moving to a partner remuneration model that favours individual performance over a whole of firm performance. The work is good but the culture isn’t collegiate and you’ll probably work in a silo, because partners won’t want to share “their” resources with other partners. You’ll be insulated from the worst of it as a junior lawyer, but it isn’t somewhere I think would be a good place to work long-term.

Work culture - Absolutely horrible and toxic. They don’t give a crap about their employees wellbeing. I worked for a level 1 prosecutor who was assigned a 6 month trial in Newcastle. She was so exhausted to the point where she was hospitalised.

Office politics: There was obvious favouritism and a lot of people who were less experienced/qualified were promoted.
Pros:
Connections: This is how I made connections with well known barristers.
Future opportunities: A lot of people use the CDPP as a stepping stone to get into the bar. If that’s what you plan to do in the future, it would definitely help.

I graduated from USYD in 2017 (final semester 2016) with an LLB, but did not pursue admission (I worked/continued study overseas).

For the last 2 years, I have been going into business with two other partners. The business is doing well and we have been receiving enquires about franchising.
The problem is that between this entrepreneurial venture, a full time white-collar job and law school, I have been on 75-80 hours week for the last 2 years, and thus, did not have much time for extracurricular activities.

I initially had the entrepreneurial venture in my resume as work experience, but now I’m considering moving it to the extracurricular column, just so I have more things to put down in the online questionnaire regarding extracurricular.
Should I do this or keep the resume as it is?
Also, how screwed am I for the lack of extracurricular activities? For further context, my WAM is 72.5 from a Go8 uni. I felt like I could have done better with extra readings, engagement etc, but I did my best with whatever little time I had after everything else.

No one can tell you whether you should or shouldn't try private practice. The main reasons I like it are: - The work is much more interesting and challenging (and the point at which your rem tops out is much higher). - In a good firm, you're exposed to many different perspectives and working with people who constantly strive to be better. This helps you to refine your own practice style and expand your own knowledge.  - Once you have experience, you get heaps of autonomy.
This obviously demands a lot more of you than your current role, but it means that you'll seldom be bored. 
It can also be difficult to be in private practice if you need a lot of flexibility due to personal commitments and family, unless you're lucky enough to work in a practice with enough non-litigious, non-urgent work to sustain you.

Disastrous-Break-399,"In regards to 'becoming a lawyer'..
So my understanding:
LLB -> PLT -> Compliance Cert -> Admission -> Practice Cert
So at admission a person can legally call themselves a lawyer and sign off on letters and emails as 'lawyer', however this does not extend to facilitating advice until they get a practice Cert which needs to be renewed annually.
I'm hoping to get a law related job in the new year and subsequently apply for a practice Cert, however, am I still a lawyer even if I don't, or if I quit that job and move into a other field, am I then a 'former lawyer'. Do I need to continue paying to a certain regulatory body to maintain my status as a lawyer? For example, today I paid my fee to VLAB to get admitted, am I a lawyer for life until I choose to no longer be or if the relevant regulatory body determines I am no longer fit to practice?

alienspiritcreature,"Slow down cowboy. You are learning highly relevant skills.
Letters of instruction to experts are exceptionally critical documents and the entire case can turn on how well a letter of instruction is drafted, and the consequent scope of an expert's inquiry. I have seen expert reports crumble under cross examination due to a poorly drafted letter of instruction. These are not basic precedent/procedural documents.
Subpoenas. Oh boy. A subpoena is an ex-parte order of the court. If you can't get your subpoenas right, forget about your pleadings. You also want to control the scope of the subpoena - sometimes you don't know what evidence you will uncover under subpoena, and there is an art in how to draft them in line with your case theory, so you get the evidence you want, without getting so much that it derails your case.
Briefs to counsel and summaries of evidence. Is this a joke? The output of your barrister will turn on how well you sumarise the case into a format they can consider for their advocacy. It will show that you are across all the relevant legal principles and how they apply. Solicitors with 15+ years of experience can't get briefs right - they send a copy of every single document in the file (without any observations/chronology), and the barrister simply won't have the time to digest all the material and identify the relevant points because the solicitor has put in no effort to doing their job. You aren't a paper pusher, you are a lawyer.
Administrative work - There are three aspects to being a solicitor: File management, managing client expectations, and being across the legal principles. All three are equally important. File management (or admin work) forms the backbone of your case. Managing a well organised file with 1000s of documents is a skill that will set you up for life as you take on gargantuan matters. Honestly, these cases fail because solicitors cannot maintain a file, and critical documents are simply lost or forgotten about, or too much of the client's money is spent trawling through the file everytime something is needed. You won't learn these skills again once you become a lawyer and start focusing more on client management and legal principles.

Have a look at the profile books put up each year for the BCL. It is very common that the Australians who get on the course have done a year or two out of University and worked as an associate/tipstaff.

AdmirableWeight9119,"Hi I just finished my second year of law/biomedical science and I was wondering whether firms look at your cumulative grade (WAM and/or GPA) if you do a double degree or whether they only care about law grades during the clerkship period. I'm also involved in extracurriculars for biomed more so than law and I don't know if that has any bearing on clerkship applications either. Both degrees require a lot of effort and time and I'm currently doing better in Biomed than law but ultimately want to pursue law as a profession so I just wanted some advice on whether I need to focus more on my law grades than my biomed grades, or focus on both of them if the cumulative GPA is what firms look at.
I was also wanting to know whether Biomed and Law is a good double degree at all, if it has any advantages for employment in the legal sector (I'm leaning towards biotech/patent law at the moment). I'm also stressed about bringing my Law WAM up to 75+ in time for clerkships in two years since my Biomed degree requires a lot of time and the units are hurdled so I really can't fail. I have an offer for law and literary studies at the moment (biomed was stressing me out in the middle of the year and was detracting from my law so I thought I would transfer to an easier double) and I've been debating on whether to take it or not.

Fluid-Economics7329,"As a qualified accountant, I’m contemplating whether I should continue studying a Bachelor of Laws while working full-time.
A bit about my background: I am a CPA and completed a Bachelor of Accounting from one of the Go8 universities. I began my career in a boutique firm and currently work at a Big 4 accounting firm. I have about 6–7 years of experience in tax—90% compliance and 10% structuring and advisory. Despite the compliance focus, my work can be complex and intellectually engaging but I’d like to transition further into advisory, which I find more rewarding. That’s mainly why I considered studying law: I hope that being dual-qualified will allow me to connect my tax experience with legal work.
Due to work and personal commitments, I'm studying part-time and expect it will take another 5 out of 6 years to complete my law degree (completed one year). However, I’m uncertain whether the law degree will actually be an advantage, so I’m weighing whether to continue or withdraw.
Here are my key concerns:
1.     Career positioning: Many of my colleagues in specialist tax teams either come from legal backgrounds or hold a double degree in law and accounting. Some have completed a JD. I know most of them began their careers in Big 4 firms within transactions or specialist tax teams. I’m not sure a Bachelor of Laws will give me the expertise and experience to do some of their works. I also think transition into the specialist team might involve a significant pay cut or a downgrade in rank. Perhaps, pursuing a CTA or a Master of Tax might have been more strategic.
2.     Time investment: Completing my law degree will take another five years. By then, I’ll have over 10 years of professional experience, and starting out as a graduate lawyer may not be viable due to age or salary expectations. Additionally, other areas of law outside of tax are likely to be niche, making transitions even more challenging.
3.     Academic choices and industry perception: I chose a non-Go8 university and a Bachelor of Laws over a JD from Go8, believing that practical knowledge matters—especially since I already hold a degree from a Go8 uni. The JD was also considerably more expensive. I don’t regret my decision but I'm beginning to realise that the legal profession places significant weight on prestige and pedigree. My grades are reasonably decent, but I’m unsure whether a six-year part-time law degree will be valued in the industry.
My future options include (unless someone can recommend better options):
a) Continuing my legal studies and seeing where it leads
b) Dropping law and pursuing a CTA or Master of Tax
c) Attempting to move into a law firm or specialist tax team now, while still studying
I’m hoping to get advice on whether I should persevere or try to enter a law firm while completing my degree. Are there other areas of law where I could apply my tax knowledge and experience? I’ve heard only some top law firms have tax team and they mainly deals with litigation and tend to be smaller and have higher thresholds (more competitive than specialist tax teams in Big 4 firms.)",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1lz7ttl/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Applications,

I enjoy my course but am considering a Bachelor of Business majoring in Business Management as it seems like a broader view of business, a field I am beginning to appreciate. Either way I will be looking to graduate as early as next year by taking a third semester this year and using my credits from previous study.
My WAM was also high enough that I was offered a place in the LLB program, a 4.25 year course, which has me graduating much later but potentially being much more employable. Law does align with my skillset being that I used to be an extremely good reader but I’m not sure my interest in practicing in the field extends beyond that of the common man, in that I’d be able to help people, have a good salary, while working in a noble profession.
Unfortunately, it is almost a further 1 hours commute each way than my current campus, when I am already travelling around 3hrs per day of class. My grandmother is increasingly ailed, and I feel I must help as much as I can and more and more because my father is beginning to show signs of age as well. This makes the study load and extra commute of the LLB a much less appealing prospect than normal and why I am even considering rejecting it. I am perfectly capable of leaving him without help for my studies, but I know it will have and already has had lasting negative effects on my personality.

insert_topical_pun,"Most law doesn't involve defending (alleged) criminals - that's criminal law, which many lawyers go their whole career without practising.
Likewise, many lawyers will never be in Court except for when they are first admitted.

In areas like insurance, personal injury, and family, (and criminal, where every matter is in court), it's unavoidable. 
Many lawyers aren't litigators, however, so I wouldn't say being a lawyer isn't for you if you don't like being in court, but some areas wouldn't be for you if that's the case.

I don’t thinks any employer treats a JD different to an LLB.
Law is a good degree to obtain if you want to practice in an area or areas of law. If you go searching around auslaw or some past threads you may find some school of thought that suggests it is also desired in executive roles, despite the holder of the degree not being required to practise whilst in those roles. I cannot expand on that from my personal experience, however, a legal degree is often said to be useful regardless of which ‘professional’ industry you go into. That is the jist.
I think you can easily obtain experience by working as a legal assistant or paralegal, sometimes they’re used interchangeably. Getting the job itself maybe harder but if you’re there you will get the experience.
I think what you will find invaluable is getting a mentor, probably harder done than said because effectively that involves someone taking an interest in your career and professional growth and deciding that they want to impart on you a fair bit of knowledge and the realities and tricks of the trade, with very little reward to them (at least in the short term).
If you want to practice in a particular area or have an idea of what area or a couple try to get exposure in those areas asap. I know you’re at university and have assignment and assessments and are working full time or part time and that’s easier said than done, however, I honestly think if a lot of 18 year olds or whatever age someone is when they’re starting their JD or LLB, regardless of age, were told to go and work in a law firm and actually got to experience it, a lot or a fair number wouldn’t continue with the degree. I am not saying that to discourage you, I am trying to tell you (if you have an area in mind or a couple) to actually go see and get a rough idea as to what the job will actually entail.
I say that because a lot of people I went to uni with didn’t have legal work until their 3rd, even more didn’t until their 4th and 5th years, by that team, you’re finished, I mean you’ve already done 3-4 years or you’re in your last year and even if you didn’t really like it or found it a bit disheartening as to what some areas of law and the systems are really like, like you’re there so you finish, why? Well 1. Because you know you have a reasonably sought after degree. 2. Because after a year or two, especially 3-4 and more PAE you can collect a 6 figure salary and it’s a living. However, I think a lot wouldn’t have gone through if they knew they’d be doing the day to day of what they’re doing now (my personal opinion).
Bottom line, get that experience, figure out if you really want it.

In terms of pay as a lawyer for legal aid or the ODPP you're getting the same at either to start, although Legal Aid has some specific types of work you can be paid overtime for, and the ODPP doesn't have any equivalent.
Legal Aid is also more generous with study leave, paying for higher education (although not PLT), and for the Bar practice course.
You can (for the moment, at least), advance thought the ODPP much faster than Legal Aid (although not everyone will). 
If you want to remain in a solicitor-like role at the ODPP you will hit a ceiling, however (although there are a few more senior solicitor-like roles for specific projects). Legal Aid has distinct senior progression paths for counsel and solicitors.
Workload at legal aid is significantly lighter than the ODPP (and I suspect the Qld ODPP has the highest workload in the country), so it's the opposite situation to what dismal_dot outlined.
To start in the Qld ODPP you'll likely have to be a clerk first (AO2.7 pay level if you have a degree - you can look it up on the certified agreement) even if admitted. You'd almost certainly need prior criminal law experience as a solicitor or barrister to start as a legal officer.
I don't think legal aid has a formal grad program at present (they've run them in the past), although they offer a much gentler & more formal introduction & training process. I'm not sure if they usually externally recruit people without experience for solicitor roles.
If you're not admitted you'd be starting in legal aid as a clerk as well (I believe A03 pay level, so a little higher - again you can look it up).",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1lz7ttl/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Offers & Rejections,

Xsh_1569,"Hi everyone, I posted here about a month ago about being stuck between staying in my Law degree or leaving it entirely.
I’m 1.5 years into a Law/International Relations double at Monash (I transferred in specifically for the Law school), and this past semester was incredibly intense. I had a serious mental health crash during the exam period, chronic insomnia, panic attacks, daily breakdowns, and barely any sleep before assessments. I was taking sleeping medication just to try and function, but it stopped working entirely during the exam period. I felt like I was on the verge of collapse every single day.
Despite all that, I somehow managed to get 88% on my Public Law exam, even though I failed one of the major quizzes earlier in the semester. It’s my highest ever law exam mark, and I’m genuinely proud of it, not just for the grade, but because it reminded me I can do this if I really push. That said, I completely crashed in Torts. I got around 59% on the exam, with a Credit mark (low 60s) overall. Ironically, Torts was the easier exam, but I had only slept for an hour the night before due to stress issues, and I spiralled hard. I remember exactly where I went wrong.
And that’s where I’m stuck.
Law feels like a never-ending cycle of stress, anxiety, and just barely coping. It’s no longer just “burnout” - it feels chronic. I’m constantly overwhelmed during the semester, and emotionally wrecked during assessments. It scares me to think that this might just be what law will always be like for me.
Over the past few months, I’ve turned down three legal job offers, not because I couldn’t do them, but because I’m genuinely passionate about the work I’m doing in IR and public policy. I currently work in a public sector role with a focus on multicultural affairs, and I truly love it. I’m supported, I feel valued, and the work is meaningful. The thought of stepping away from that for clerkships or PLT honestly makes me feel a bit sad.
At the same time, seeing my marks has made me feel more capable, maybe I can finish the law degree after all. But I’ve also realised that the standard 2 Law / 2 IR load is too much for me. So, I’ve made the decision to underload next semester: 1 Law, 3 IR subjects, to see if a lighter load makes it more manageable.
I’m still caught in between futures: -If I stay, will I always be miserable - even if I finish?
-If I leave, will I regret it - or worse, lose future opportunities I haven’t even discovered yet?
I also worry about the practical impact of underloading:
-Will employers assume I failed subjects when they see how long my degree took?
-If I disclose that I underloaded for mental health reasons, will that be a red flag?
-If I later decide I do want to practice, will I have shot myself in the foot by turning down all those early legal jobs and clerkships? I know it will be harder next year to find legal work, and even harder to find a clerkship the year after with no actual legal experience, high level office experience can only take me so far.
Originally, I wanted to become a barrister, but since studying and working in IR, that dream’s shifted. I still could go down the legal path. But I worry I'm not cut out for it.
Would love to hear from anyone who’s been in a similar situation, especially those who either left law, or stayed but took a different path through it. Has underloading affected your employment prospects? Did you regret not getting early legal experience? Or did you find your way into law later without following the standard route?
Thanks again to everyone who responded to my original comment - it helped more than you know.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1lz7ttl/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Interviews,
AdvocateMoonMoose,"Hello  xsh, 
Personal experience:
My degree took ~ 10 years from when I left school to when I finished law. I failed one degree, had a break, did another part-time, then ended up in law. I had a paralegal job, and then got a job immediately as a graduate. I didn't get a clerkship.
Firstly, nobody ever asked me about why I took which law subject when. I did some 3 subject semesters, too. That's also not really underloading if you're doing 4 subjects per semester. I mean it's a good response if the question was ever asked - ""why did you take 1 law subject per semester?"" ""There were 3 subjects in my other degree I had available at that time"".
It would look significantly better to take a measured approach to law and achieve excellent grades, rather than stress yourself out and do poorly (or fail and incur further financial penalties in needing to take subjects again). Excellent grades only make things easier, they are not a hard barrier.
If you want to practice law, taking a clerk or paralegal role is going to be better sooner rather than later. Some employers may not care, but the door will be open to those who do, as well. Make sure you enquire about progression pathways, so if you don't land your dream graduate job, the existing firm will have a role for you (but don't phrase it like this). If you prefer your other job, think about if you really want to be a lawyer? Law is helpful in policy and other related areas.
I don't see why you would disclose it was for mental health reasons, at least without that being a continuingly relevant issue. You'd probably want an official diagnosis and discussion with a mental health professional about getting better, so you are assured you are not just attempting to cover personal issues in the blanket of webMD pseudo-medicine.
RE exams: you must force yourself to be well rested and hydrated, well fed, and put-together. Nobody else has your back in this regard. If you know you get stressed, take some time and develop strategies to effectively assist. If you can't, again, seek professional help. There's no honour in soloing a law degree.
Most of your hypothetical worries are unanswerable. What's the point of thinking about what opportunities you were not offered? Deal with the immediate, have a broad plan, but be flexible in seeking new opportunities. It's possible in 10 years that there will be entire new fields of law-adjacent professional jobs that are currently unimaginable. Take the time to consider each option you are given as it comes to you, you are not guaranteed any further options.
Further to the recommendation to see a mental health professional (if required), also talk to a careers/course advisor.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1lz7ttl/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Offers & Rejections,
AdmirableSystem3754,"It sounds like you need to defer a semester (or longer), so you can have some intensive mental health care and think about what you want for your future. No one here can tell you what to do with your life or has the answers. You need to do some soul searching once you are well.
What I can tell you is that employers do not care about under loading or taking time off your degree. I doubt they’d even notice it. You don’t need to give a reason why you took longer to do a degree and I wouldn’t recommend disclosing private health information. You can always say you needed some extra time to figure out your career journey which is obviously true and will make you sound more committed in any interview if you can justify why you’ve pursued X path.

I have worked in public policy and hated it. I enjoy working in-house, which I have done on/off for 15 years. You need to remember that non all legal jobs are the same, and the work you do at Uni often has nothing to do with the job/tasks you do when you are employed. That said, I agree with the OR, in that, you should take some time off and assess whether legal is right for you.

Cashflow can be a bit lumpy. That is true for any barrister, but it is worse for readers, because they don't yet have a backlog of outstanding invoices that will trickle in over time. But ""devilling"" (doing work for other barristers) can help with early cashflow, because barristers will generally pay invoices on the same day or very soon after.

have a spouse who is not working in a similar job and has much lower level of career time commitment; or
nannies (and cleaner etc)
Or, I guess, part time (but this has its own set of issues) or reduce your sleeping hours.
Basically it is very difficult to have a young family and work in a top tier unless someone else takes up the time you cannot spend on the family (or family related activities, like cooking). You can mitigate the issues to some small degree (eg prepare lots of meals on the weekend and freeze them, eat only stir fries and pasta and frozen oven food during the week, home delivery groceries) but you wont cover everything. So you need a spouse or hired help to cover it.
That said, the other option is to put your ambition on hold for 10 years and accept you will sit in your well paid but not advancing position unless and until you decide to go full on. This wont prevent the issues but will give you a little bit more family time. It doesnt work for all areas of practice or all partners or all the time so you cant predict in advance.

Quirky_Lobster_1001,"Apologies if this has been asked before or if it is a laughably naive question, but I was genuinely interested in the practicality of obtaining a law degree later in life (ie: 50's), in order to practice in a volunteer capacity for community work in retirement from my main career (in corporate project management and delivery). From what I can see, qualification aside, it seems the only way to achieve this would be to complete the supervisory period as a (very) senior graduate. As my full time career has gone well, a significant earnings downgrade in my final earning years before retirement would be a problem. So I would need to complete this after, or very close to retirement age (late 50's)
To re-iterate, this would be purely voluntary as I recognise I would be much older and far less experienced than the rest of the industry - so it wouldn't be for money. I'm wondering is there a need to free community work, or is this already adequately serviced by retired practitioners?

Suspicious-Ear7407,"There’s a little bit to unpack here, but I’ll try my best to help.
The first point is if you want to be a lawyer (your last paragraph makes me think you do), you’re in the wrong degree. Masters of Law degrees don’t offer a pathway to legal practice. You’ll want to be doing a Juris Doctor instead.
Secondly, law is quite different to other academic disciplines taught at University. I can go into more detail if helpful, but it suffices to say that there are core skills in law you won’t necessarily have picked up in other degrees (e.g., statutory interpretation, legal research (i.e., caselaw), legal writing, etc.). You shouldn’t be too harsh on yourself for not having these skills from before studying law, because they are only really taught in law.
Thirdly, working in law is nothing like studying law. You use the skills I mention above, and might remember a useful case or principle, but generally speaking the two are very different. I also don’t know any lawyer who has “[committed] to law their entire life”. Most lawyers favourite topic is what they’d be doing instead of law if only this or that were different (see e.g.: Auslaw’s regular rant thread).
Only you can make the call as to whether or not you push forward. You need to weigh whether or not you want to push through or pull out. If you decide to stick with it, I’d personally suggest really honing in on those basic toolkit skills - they’re essential for learning how to find and apply the law correctly.

Otherwise this is salient advice! JD is very hard and very different to a commerce undergrad. Have a think about whether you’re spending enough time studying/working on your assignments/ implementing feedback. Talk to other people in your course and talk to the unit coordinators.

You should also probably be aware that any junior paralegal or legal assistant role will largely be admin or other non-substantive legal work.

hunglingyiu,"Hi all, I have some questions regarding Supervised Legal Training (SLT) in Victoria and could really use your advice.
Background
-          I am a Permanent Resident holder from Hong Kong, my English is okay but not great (Around 8 overall in IELTS and 7 at best in speaking).
-          I completed my Bachelor of Laws in the UK with a 2:1 grade (which is equivalent to a D in Australia?), and I am currently studying a graduate diploma at Monash with a WAM of 74.5. I have 4 modules left to complete.
-          The only work experience I had was a 2-week summer intern at a mid-tier firm and 4-month paralegal role at a boutique firm in Hong Kong. I did not participate in extra-curricular activities during university and have almost zero connections here in Australia.
After graduating from Monash, I’m leaning towards pursuing SLT rather than a PLT course since not only it allows me to have hands-on experience, but it also helps ease my financial burden. So far, I have applied for 16 graduate programs and have already received 2 rejections. I am starting to feel like getting a SLT role as a non-local might be difficult, especially given my limited experience and lack of exceptional academic achievements.
My questions are:
-          What can I do in the following months to increase my chances of getting a SLT role?
-          Would applying to rural firms increase my chances and if so, how should I apply? Do I just look it up on Seek or do I need to take the initiative and send my CV to them? I’ve always had the perception that rural firms, due to limited resources, might be hesitant to offer these roles.
-          Are SLTs really better than PLT courses? Alternatively, I was thinking to enrol in PLT full/part time whilst getting a paid job such as a paralegal.

If you’re doing SLT through a third party provider, you should only really do it if you don’t have any thing else to do. It takes up more time and takes away opportunities to actually work (as you need to attend SLT).
You’re probably better off doing PLT and continuing to look for jobs.

There are external providers like Leos that offer an SLT program but you need to pay for it yourself (so you're better off doing a PLT program).
In practice, the following are the two main pathways to admission:
Graduate role, undertake PLT (firm organises and pays which most do, or you pay for this yourself).
No graduate role, undertake PLT (you organise and pay)
I think you're confusing SLT with a graduate program. SLT is a specific process through which you qualify for admission to be a lawyer.

I've recently become very interested in pursuing an international LLM (and have lots of personal reasons for wanting to do so and am under no illusion it'll further my career and am aware of how much it costs). But I have been utterly destroying myself inside for months for not doing honours in my undergrad. I absolutely had the marks for it, but just decided at the time (due to various personal life dramas) that I wouldn't have enough energy to dedicate to doing well. I even reached out to the dean of my law school to see if there was a possibility of doing it appended but apparently it's not something that's offered.
This has obviously made the path to an international LLM somewhat harder. Lots of UK unis have a first class as a bare minimum requirement, though other countries (including US) don't seem to care as much. I've picked up a sessional academic gig at the Uni I studied at and plan to stick with it for at least this year (teaching Contracts and maybe Competition in second semester). I've been told I should also try publishing something but I don't even really know where to begin with that.
Has anyone here done an international LLM without honours? And would having a year or two teaching experience, maybe a paper or two in some small journals, and having graduated in the top 10% of my class (albeit without honours) be equivalent experience to having done honours?

Advanced_Sleep_5567,"Hi everyone, I’m a first year law student and would really like some advice about studying and averaging distinctions & high distinctions.
I’m feeling very overwhelmed, and it’s currently week 4. I feel like I don’t have an effective system in place and feel like I’m falling behind or missing information. I am making sure I attend every class which definitely helps consolidate information.
My system currently is to complete the readings - watch lectures - do activities - attend class (do this for each unit)
I do this by using google drive, where I have 4 folders for each unit, then each folder has 3 google documents where I take my notes for readings, lectures, and class notes. Here are my questions:
1) Readings - It is taking me along time to actually do the readings, and then I make notes on each topic, and then I extract the relevant cases and put them into a table. However this is taking me hours for 1 subject, and I end up giving up by the end because I haven’t even started watching the lectures yet. Is there a better system? Or any advice on how to be more efficient?
2) Outlining - from my understanding, this is where you consolidate all your information and make a document for exam preparation. Should I be starting this now? Or do I wait until 4-5 weeks out from the exam?
3) How much time should I be spending all up for each unit (excluding time in class)?
4) Any other tips on how to average high marks
I know this is my first year and I will learn to become faster, and learn skills like how to read cases, however I am just feeling very overwhelmed and would like some reassurance on how I can get through my first year and get into a good system/routine.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1jczjr2/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Interviews,

Monkey_Junkie_No1,"Hey everyone, I’m seeking advice on my next career move. Here are some details about me:
I hold a UK law degree but haven’t qualified fully or practiced law. I’m sorting that out through the Legal Practice Admission Board in New South Wales because it’s more affordable (Diploma in Law). I’ll start studying Australian Constitutional Law in September this year.
I recently moved to Brisbane from the UK three months ago. I’ll finish my current contract job around July and need to find another job, likely part-time, to allow me to study.
I need to earn a good 2-3k per month to support myself. I’m looking for a role that I can easily get with my background as an HR advisor (assume I have the standard skillset). This role should also qualify me towards the practice requirements for my future PLT to save effort and time later on and build up on some crucial experience. My areas of interest are employment law and related.
I’m still a bit unclear about what would work best for me. When I did some general searches on Seek, I wasn’t sure if I qualified for any roles at this stage. For example, paralegal requires significant experience in a similar legal role with specific skills related to law, which I clearly don’t have or require TAFE or an equivalent qualification, which I won’t be able to obtain.
Can you suggest some job titles and functions that would be a good fit for my circumstances in your experience?

They typically pay $30-$35 per hour and I doubt you will be able to meet your required $2-3k per month post tax working part time.
Regarding required experience, you were likely looking at a role advertised or intended for a career paralegal.

Mysterious_Year_6266,"Functionally there is very little difference between the roles if you are working towards admission as you are. Paralegal work tends to be more on the more administrative than legal side, however when you are a law student firms tend to throw you more substantive stuff regardless.
Generally law clerk positions are reserved for current students or recent graduates and are offered as part of a structured introductory program to a firm, designed to entice them to return as a graduate lawyer. As such they tend to be 'funner' as the firm has an incentive to try and keep you engaged in interesting work so that you'll take the bait. Most who do successfully complete a clerkship revert back to being a paralegal by title regardless. I mentioned law clerk mainly due to some firms still using that title for positions that are effectively a paralegal role.
Re clerkships, I've not encountered anyone doing the GDLP in a law clerk cohort, however I can't imagine you wouldn't be eligible. Plenty of information on this sub and on the internet if you are interested as this is the main pipeline to securing grad roles in the commercial space.
Edit: definitely setup a job alert on LinkedIn. You'll get daily emails for positions in your city and you can apply directly through the platform. Most firms advertise on LinkedIn now.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1jczjr2/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Applications,

one_small_sunflower,"Should I even bother seeking admission to practise?
I’ve been studying for 7 years and now I’m doing my GDLP. I spend pretty much every waking hour studying but that’s clearly not enough because I failed one of my assessments.
If I can’t even pass despite my efforts, I’m probably not smart enough to be a lawyer. I’ve been rejected from almost every firm I’ve applied to because I simply don’t have the people skills needed in this job. In the other cases, the firm just didn’t have a job to give me.
I should never have studied law. I should have just done IR/PoliSci as a standalone degree because I’m already good at that. I would have been happier, healthier, attained a higher GPA, and probably landed a job closer to what I actually wanted.
Law school seems to have gotten me nowhere despite all of the work involved and the sacrifices I’ve had to make. It never seems to be enough.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1jczjr2/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Interviews,
one_small_sunflower,"Caveat lector: it would be unwise to rely on the perspective of an anonymous redditor who would be unable to distinguish between you and a goose were it not for your username. (Geese don't typically enjoy pepsi, though they do sometimes go to law school.)
Quite possibly, I am a goose myself, and don't you forget it!
I’ve been studying for 7 years and now I’m doing my GDLP. I spend pretty much every waking hour studying but that’s clearly not enough because I failed one of my assessments.
If I can’t even pass despite my efforts, I’m probably not smart enough to be a lawyer. 
So, you finished your law degree - but while completing your GDLP, you failed one of your GDLP assessments, even though you spent a lot of time studying. Because of this, you conclude that you're 'probably not smart enough to be a lawyer'.
Hmm. Catch-22. On the one hand, there's nothing about failing a single assessment that indicates insufficent smarts for a legal career. On the other, you've clearly concluded that there is, which is illogical. So maybe there is something to worry about after all ;)
Unless the times have really changed, GDLP is less intellectually demanding than law school. I've seen plenty of people drop out of GDLP, but not because it's just so damn thinky. I have never seen anyone complete a law degree but then fall at the GDLP hurdle because they didn't have the brainpower.
So no, your GDLP result isn't evidence of being 'not smart enough' to be a lawyer. I don't know why you failed despite studying very hard, but that isn't it. QED.
I’ve been rejected from almost every firm I’ve applied to because I simply don’t have the people skills needed in this job. In the other cases, the firm just didn’t have a job to give me.
People skills are skills, and skills can be learned. Plenty of books and YT content out there or pay a professional for coaching if you have the $$.
I'm confused about why the firms were advertising if they didn't have jobs to offer, but in any event, that's not a reflection on you.
I should never have studied law. I should have just done IR/PoliSci as a standalone degree because I’m already good at that. I would have been happier, healthier, attained a higher GPA, and probably landed a job closer to what I actually wanted.
Nonetheless, you have studied law, so the question is: do you want to use your law degree now that you've obtained it, and if so, how?
Life is short. Getting a law degree doesn't mean becoming a lawyer. Do you still want your IR/Politics-type career? If so, then pursue it - no harm no foul. You are just at the beginning. Don't get trapped by the sunk cost fallacy if this really isn't it for you.
7 years feels like forever - I took 8, thanks to a fun combo of disabillty and a string of deaths and serious illnesses in my family. I was so ground down by the end of it that I'm pretty sure the main reason I graduated from my goose degree was that I couldn't live with all that suffering being for nothing. Now I look back and those years are just a haze.
Speaking of, I did not get a job as a goose right after I graduated from university. That took about 3 years. I remember how many times I wanted to scream, cry, or ragequit, or become catatonic with despair. But I didn't, and years later, I am a moderately-sized goose with an enjoyable job honking at people about things I find interesting.
This comment may sound quite tough, and also possibly, extremely silly. This is because I am both those things. You need to be if you're someone for whom the doors don't open straight away. You can wallow for a bit, but don't give into those impulses for too long if a legal career really is what you want.

(deleted),"Firstly, I don't think you need to be massively worried about your marks if you're getting Ds and HDs in assignments and high credits for exams. That should average out to a D average, no? That's still competitive. It's healthy to want to do better but don't put so much pressure on yourself, it's counterproductive.
I agree that most marks are gained from the A stage. I went to a GO8 uni that had open-book exams so what I used to do is have a pre-written R statement for each of the rules/tests discussed in the course. Then I just copied that R statement if I identified it as the rule for a particular issue raised in the exam. If you don't have open-book exams, just try to memorise it as best you can. This saved me time to focus more on the application because I had a nicely phrased statement of the law ready to go without having to think any further because I did the thinking beforehand.
When it comes to questions of law that are not entirely settled, you should state the rule as whatever has the strongest support but acknowledge the uncertainty if the position is not settled (eg splits in intermediate appellate courts or different positions by different intermediate appellate courts) or emerging (eg new concepts from the HCA that is the subject of well reasoned dissents). If you're unsure, usually your lecturer will have their own views about what they consider to be the better view.
You then apply the law on the assumption that the most supported rule is what will yield the ""correct"" answer. You should acknowledge that your conclusion is not firm if the law is not settled. You don't need to apply the alternative rule or view in an exam — it is not an efficient use of your time.
When it comes to application, I think my best exam notes would contain a list of the kinds of things I need to think about (eg, relevant factors raised by subsequent intermediate decisions, the kinds of issues raised by the caselaw so that I am alert to them, the kinds of facts that might mean a particular conclusion is more likely). You should treat as a reference list of things to keep an eye out for, not a checklist of everything that needs to be mentioned in your answer — this is where you use your discernment to write an answer that is complete without irrelevant fluff.

hunglingyiu,"Hi all, I got some questions regarding finding entry-level legal jobs in Australia, especially in Melbourne.
A little background: PR with Chinese background, studied LLB in UK, had 5 months of full-time legal work experience in Hong Kong, completed Graduate Diploma in Australian Law at Monash with Distinction, struggling to find a legal job, currently working as unpaid intern at a law firm.
Several question I would like to ask:
1.    Could my academic qualification be a reason why I am not getting any interview chances? Since I only needed to fulfil the Priestly 11 subjects to commence PLT, I chose to study the graduate diploma for time and cost considerations. However, I noticed that a lot people are unfamiliar with the qualification, and a solicitor I am currently working with suggested that this could be the reason why I am not getting interviews. Is it likely that my academic background is causing me to be screened out? How can I effectively communicate to recruiters that I am as qualified as someone with an LLB or JD?
2.    Regarding the above question, I noticed that when applying on Seek I am often required to answer questions like ‘How many years of experience do you have in XXX?’. If my response do not align with the role’s requirement, am I likely to be automatically filtered out by the algorithm or by the recruiter? In this case, would emailing my CV directly to the recruiter better? I tried it before and got ghosted.
3.    Is gaining experience in non-legal roles worthwhile? I read from previous discussions that administrative or customer service roles could be beneficial in getting a legal job. With this in mind, I recently started applying for such positions and was offered an interview for a receptionist/admin role at an accounting firm. However, after the interview, the firm’s principal advised me to focus on finding a legal job, stating that while the role would provide transferable skills, it would not offer the practical legal experience crucial for the legal profession. As a result, I am conflicted about whether to continue applying for non-legal jobs. Although my family supports me financially, I really want to become financially independent and secure a paid position.

LogorrhoeanAntipode,"Certainly you should consider whether checking the definitions on procurement contracts for a company is really beyond the pale for you, but let's say it is:
Clients you don't like are more likely to show up in some practice areas than others. Good chance you can settle somewhere you're more morally comfortable.
Government regulators can also have morally questionable impacts, although certainly you're less likely to be assisting the manufacturers of the BabyKiller 9000 superbomb.
Factors to consider here are pay (slightly lower at the start of your career and a much lower potential for future earnings), risk of being pigeonholed into that regulators area (easier to move to a different area from a private firm because of the broader training), and much better work life balance once you're admitted. Personally I have also found that the quality of lawyers in regulators to be a bit more hit-or-miss. Plenty of very good lawyers, but far more terrible ones too. You also have to deal with public service bureaucracy (e.g. having to go through an interview process for promotions, change in government throwing everything into disarray, etc). Depends how strongly you feel but the T6 grad offer gives you more flexibility. If you take it and later decide you don't want to hang around, you can move to a regulator much more easily than the reverse.
Positions in the Australian Government Solicitor's office and the AG's department are on point here, but hard to get. T6 grad roles are obviously also hard to get, but you've already gotten there. If you move to Canberra there are also lots of legal roles within individual agencies, but you're less likely to do interesting public law work and more likely to do dull statutory interpretation and contract management for government. There are teams in T6 and other national firms which have good admin teams doing admin disputes work for government, lots of migration work, etc. They're often smaller teams and (for Commonwealth government) often Canberra based, but there are also opportunities in real cities. Check out the legal services panel list.

LogorrhoeanAntipode,"This is a tough question to answer because it will depend on the firm and location. It's the kind of thing that will become reasonably apparent through a grad rotation, and you'd have the opportunity to settle in a different area if you had concerns (not that you'd necessarily say that's why you picked a different area).
Leaving before the end of a graduate program is probably a bit of a red flag for future employers, and you don't get the benefit of having really received the level of training that major firms offer compared to public service or smaller firms. With that said 12-18 months usually is the full grad program.

Rhybrah,"Sports Law is a bit of a misnomer as it includes a lot of very standard areas of law (e.g. IP, commercial contracts, corporate law - they don't suddenly change just because the client is a sports club). Your first step will likely be working out what exactly want to be doing in sports - is it general commercial law or are you looking at more specialised disputes (e.g. employment, doping etc.).
Probably the most likely places to get exposure to the commercial side of professional sports is any of the big law firms or going in-house for one of the organisations (a club or the sporting body itself). I would recommend aiming for a top tier clerkship and maybe their grad program if possible.
An alternative career path could be Sport Integrity Australia which does a lot of regulatory-type work around sports.

potatochip678,"My manager graduated with a pass and she’s one of the best lawyers and the most incredible mentor I’ve ever met. It’s a slog but if it’s something you really want to do you just have to work your way up. You’ve obviously done well enough to get into law so you’re more than capable.
My personal tips are: - always do the lectures before class. They’ll always highlight the key cases you need to know. Pay attention to the facts because problem questions will usually be based on the cases you’ve studied in the lecture. - learn to issue spot. Most of the time it doesn’t really matter which way you argue as long as you explain why but you’ll miss out on marks if you miss out on the issues or spend too long talking about irrelevant things. - read case summaries instead. The cases they give are never that obscure. There’s always a summary somewhere. I can’t remember the last time I read a case for uni but I have for work so it’s still a skill worth developing. - ask lots of questions in class. I work full time and am extremely time poor so class time is my chance to really cement everything in my brain or in my notes.
To do well in an exam, my strategy is to aim to spot all the issues, show them that I’ve understood the key concepts of the subject and can identify the relevant case law, and show the marker I know how to apply the law to the facts and make an argument. I treat it like a bit of a game to just tick the boxes on the rubric.

Prioritise lectures. Do the readings if you can, but make absolutely sure you go to every single lecture. You don't need to be across every single fact of the case, but you do need to know what the case means, and your lecturer is going to explain that.
In exams, facts > principles. Don't spend 10 minutes regurgitating everything you learned in class. Spot the issue, state the principle, then make an argument based on the facts and your own judgement. Of course, it depends on the issue, but your lecturer will probably flag which principles need more attention.
But don't neglect principles. You need to be across the elements of all of the issues, and how they apply to different factual matrices. Again, lectures are absolutely key. Don't try to stare at cases and think you can make sense of them on your own.
I don't want to tell you not to worry, since your marks do matter, and you clearly have work you need to do. But having bad first year marks isn't fatal, what's important is that you learn from this and can produce good results moving forward. Spend some time talking to peers, seniors, teaching staff, and figure out where you're going wrong.

As a junior this is generally neither here nor there, but as you get to senior lawyer and above the difference is reflected in your pay (ie you get paid less because you arent making the same revenue/profit even though you bill the same number of hours).
Offset against, of course, cheaper housing and other prices, shorter commutes etc. So overall you probably come out ahead financially vs someone in Sydney. Although you never get to see a live band or new play or many major sporting events.
Whether, in fact, the hours you work are the same is very variable. Even within a Sydney office there will be some people billing 5 hours a day and some billing 10+.

After getting admitted I moved overseas for an LLM, after which I stayed overseas for another 7 years working in various legal roles with the UN in different places in Africa and Asia. My experience is primarily in administrative law, human rights law, drafting/reviewing legislation.
I’ve recently had to move back to Australia (Sydney) and am trying to work out my next career move. I’m interested to hear if anyone has any similar experiences or advice on next career steps. How is international/UN legal experience viewed from a recruitment perspective? If I wanted to chart a course to move into something well paid in the private sector, with no domestic experience beyond my PLT placement, where would be the best place to start?
Apologies if there are obvious responses to these questions of if they’ve already been answered elsewhere. I don’t have local professional networks or connections, am anxious about cost of living pressures and am generally at a bit of a loss where to begin. Any advice is sincerely appreciated.

Sorry for being another post asking for career advice but I feel a bit lost and am sure that someone out there could help 😊.
I finished my final law exams in October and have been working in unrelated areas all through my studies. My plan was always to finish my degree and then get my foot in the door and gain experience and show that I would be a valuable member to a team of lawyers. Now that it's all said and done I'm finding that all my peers at uni had managed to get jobs and clerkships in law during uni.
I feel that I've sort of missed the boat so to speak and now with no experience other than an internship at a CLC, there will always be better applicants on paper for the jobs I apply for.
My most passionate area of law is criminal law and I really struggle to see any positions in firms that specialise in that. Would it be silly for me to email firms that don't have ads up to put my self forward in case they needed any type of work even if its just administrative to get my foot in the door or would this just be a nuisance?
Are there any tips on the types of listings that I should keep an eye out for?
Should I just grow up and keep applying and know that everyone struggles?
Any tips would be appreciated 🙏 TIA",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1hf62mh/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Applications,

Re: criminal law - unfortunately all the feedback I got during my initial job hunt in Melbourne looking for criminal law jobs was that firms greatly prefer to promote paralegals to lawyers rather than hire baby lawyers.

I'm a lawyer but have been working in tax at a Big 4 accounting firm. I'm currently a manager and my day-to-day consists of tax structuring advice, due diligence (for M&A) and other ad hoc work. Very limited compliance.
I've recently been approached by one of the more recognisable law firms to potentially move across, still in the early stages of discussions at the moment.
I'm looking for some guidance on two things: 1) role equivalency - what's the equivalent role to Manager at a law firm and what's the step above that? 2) salary - I earn $130k package with 5 years of experience. Any guide for what the above roles may pay?

borbdorl,"1) senior associate / SA is the equivalent role to manager. Generally, most SAs got there about 5-7 years PAE.
Special counsel is typically the step above that, but this can vary. Some firms have legal director / of counsel / managing associate instead. Some go straight to partner from SA. Some have SC but it's an alternative pathway to partnership track with a more technical ""on the tools"" rather than business ""bringing in work"" focus (this was traditionally the case before firms started making it a stepping stone on the partnership track to slow progression to partnership by a few years).
2) REM can also vary wildly. If you're at a top tier and make SA you're likely to be above $200k. If you're at a mid tier you'll usually be 10-20% lower. If you're still an associate you'll likely be between 120k-150k depending on the firm.

Old_money_mermaid,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for different perspectives on my situation that I’ll explain below.
I’m a 29 y/o American with dual NZ citizenship that has lived in NZ for the past 6 years so my connection to America has waned. I’m currently reevaluating my career from biotech. I applied and was accepted to a CSP place in the jd program at Usyd that right now I’m really interested in. Unfortunately, I can’t help but wonder if I’m doing myself a disservice since I know Australians tend to go to London and the U.S. after a few years PQE. I also recognize starting salaries for the top grads are also higher but that’s only if you “make it”.
I’m hesitant to go to school in the U.S. because it’s essentially a race to top schools and from those schools, a race to big law. And you’re stuck a big price tag if it doesn’t work out exactly how you plan it to.
Since I’m a technically a domestic student in Aus, the price tag and visa aren’t as much of an issue for other Americans. Also, I’m used to the high cost of living being in NZ (which is arguably higher in some ways).
Eventually I’d like to work between Aus and NZ and maybe the U.S. and possibly open my own firm/ be a sole practitioner.

Either path I will end up with some HECS debt in the $50s-60sk. I honestly cannot see a definitively better option.

- LLB with honours is considered more impressive than just a JD (can anyone confirm this?)
- At ANU, I can be out in 4 yrs practising law, and hopefully get my firm to sponsor my LLM overseas. While at Unimelb it will be 6 yrs before I can practise
- At both unis I will have to maintain a 70 WAM to keep my scholarships/CSP JD place. Which will be harder to do? In LLB at ANU, or B.Comm Actuary major at Unimelb?
- Is it true than JD is harder/heavier workload and longer essays than LLB?
- Unimelb I would spend my undergrad yrs living w family, some commute to the cbd. At ANU I have a place on campus, in Canberra's city centre, but would need to look after myself, cook all meals for these next 4 yrs.

Coupled with living in a smaller city and out of home, it can be easier to make friends and expand your social circle. However, you can also get that at Melbourne, you might just need to put in a bit more effort in joining clubs/student societies etc.
In terms of your choice between the two options, I would lean towards Melbourne because it probably gives you more flexibility. In particular:
- The extra time will give you more time and opportunities (over 6 years rather than 4), including to travel outside of uni as well as explore exchange programs and other programs whether through uni or outside. (Also, if you overload your undergrad, you can probably finish it in 2.5 years and have half a year off to travel/enjoy life before starting your law degree).
- You'll have the opportunity to do internships in your penultimate year of your undergrad and you may find that you don't want to do law.
The other thing to keep in mind is that uni will be some of the best years of your life and you should try and soak in as much of it as you can. 2 extra years is not that much more time.
I'd also be hesitant about doing a straight law degree in case you end up finding it's not something you enjoy or want to do (and I'm not sure how easy it would be for you transfer to a different degree at ANU and keep your scholarship).
In terms of your questions, my 2 cents:
- I don't think which uni you go to will have a material impact on your prospects of transferring overseas. The firm you work at, the practice area and your grades (to a lesser extent) will be far more important.
- I don't think an ""honours"" degree is necessarily that much more impressive than either a straight law degree or a JD. It might assist if you are looking to go into academia or looking at further education, but otherwise, your grades will be more important.
- I haven't heard of firms sponsoring people doing overseas LLMs (once you have started working). At best you'll be granted a leave of absence and in rare cases the firm might pay for your course (in the same way they might pay for a local LLM which is more common). However, the utility of an LLM is questionable unless you want to go into academia or practise overseas - it certainly has a very marginal impact on your career prospects in Australia. If you are looking to do an LLM before starting a job at a firm, I'd suggest applying for the (very competitive) scholarships that are available. If you've been offered a graduate role and want to do an LLM, the bigger firms will usually be more flexible with allowing you to defer your start date.
- I can't really comment on which uni will be harder to maintain a 70 WAM, however, the actuarial subjects can be very difficult. The other thing to keep in mind is that people who have done well in high school don't necessarily do well in uni where you have to be a lot more self reliant. I will say that you'll have a lot more flexibility with subject selection at Melbourne and you can always switch to a different major.
- I think the JD tends to be harder than the LLB not because the content or assessment is necessarily different or harder but because it's a graduate degree and so the students will be older, a bit more mature and the expectations will be higher and so it leads to the course being quite competitive.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1hkb95b/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Applications,

Ig it's just that after taking 2 uni subjects early this yr I found uni is pretty heavy itself, or at least not as fun and lax as is often said.

- I haven't heard of firms sponsoring people doing overseas LLMs (once you have started working)
that's too bad :'( I initially heard of this from Singaporean lawyers, over there it's common at big firms so I got really hopeful and didn't realise it isn't done here in Aus.

Perhaps, but you have to weigh it up against the other factors I've mentioned. The other thing to keep in mind is that you normally want to go to uni where you want to work and while ANU is a bit of an exception, you'll likely be working in either Canberra (doing largely work for government clients) or in Sydney (and competing against students from there).",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1hkb95b/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Locations,

LogorrhoeanAntipode,"These are great options to have, well done.
Choice between Uni Melb and ANU should probably fall to two factors: where do you want to work in Australia (Victoria or Canberra/NSW) and what style of teaching do you prefer. It's easier to find work in the region where you study, so Melbourne is more advantageous if you want to stay in Victoria for work before heading overseas. I also understand that Uni Melb has smaller class sizes and mostly uses small tutorial formats, whereas ANU relies on at-large lectures and tutorials of ~25-30 (sometimes more) students.
Your university's international reputation will probably be less impactful for international employers after you've been at a firm for a few years, but I don't think Melbourne has a worse reputation overseas. Certainly more people outside Australia have heard of Melbourne (and so will recognise the University of Melbourne) than have heard of Canberra/ANU. The more impactful thing will be the reputation of the firm you work at in Australia.
LLB (Hons) is not necessarily more prestigious than a JD. Many people outside law (or in the US) will assume the JD is a higher qualification than any kind of undergrad irrespective of honours. Honours is really useful if you want the opportunity to go into academia or do prestigious postgraduate study (e.g. Oxford BCL or Cambridge LLM).
If you're bright and hardworking, the 70 WAM will be reasonably easy to maintain at either institution.
I'm not in a position to give advice on the relative time taken or living at home vs on campus (these are a personal preferences above all), or the relative difficulty of a UM JD vs ANU LLB.

Hedge your bets on conclusions (ie on the facts there is clear merit to x position but given that y is unclear there could be a different view if y is z).
Other than that, if it’s a time / pressure issue (which seems to be the case if you can pull HDs in assessments) then repetitively smashing practice exams will help.

Lancair04,"I did it. It is not very hard if you are a native English speaker and do not suffer from test taking anxieties or similar difficulties. Americans will talk about it like it’s the hardest thing they’ve ever done but these are people who have lived very sheltered lives.
The high foreign-educated fail rates are largely people who do not speak English fluently or have any common law background. Australians and Canadians do basically as well as Americans. Personally, I didn’t know of anyone who was a vaguely serious Australian lawyer who didn’t pass on the first time.
A few points:
It is essentially an elaborate verbal IQ test. You need to read and write fast. Most of the difficulty comes from complex wording on the multiple choice section (double negatives, throwing in concepts which sound similar but are different like subordination and subrogation etc etc).
You do need to cram for 1-2 months to learn the subject matter and the art of bar taking.
Aesthetically, it is an imposing test taking environment. Big room, strict rules etc. Someone will probably flip out and run out midway during the test.
Make sure you understand how the test is graded. There is a large margin for error provided you don’t completely shit the bed on the multiple choice section. The most important thing is to do a solid performance on the multiple choice sections. If you get a slightly above average score in the 140s it’s basically impossible to fail since the essay sections are graded on a curve and if you answer in English with reference to the facts and some law you will easily get the ~120 you need to pass with your 140 MBE.
I would strongly recommend using Themis rather than Barbri for bar prep. It’s cheaper, more efficient and less anxiety inducing than Barbri, which my wife used (although she got one of the highest scores for a foreign educated lawyer on the NY bar ever, so maybe that’s not such a bad thing….)",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1hkb95b/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Firm Culture,

I'm at TT firm and 90% grads and lawyers are Monash and UniMelb. RMIT, Deakin and LaTrobe are rare, though not entirely because of their perceived quality of teaching...some of it has to do with the student demographics and uni culture (e.g., they're less inclined to join or funnel students to TT firms).
The learning environment has an impact on the amount of effort you will put and the quality you will be conditioned to expect of yourself.
There's also the cohort effect. In 5 or 15 years, your law school cohorts will be senior associates or partners in high-powered firms or leaving those firms for in-house or ELL govt positions.

I am thinking of applying for clerkships this year and am trying to fix up my CV. I've seen a couple of posts speak about including an 'interests' section at the end of the CV which I will do.

I'm interested in getting to the bar as soon as possible. I'm currently a Judge's Associate in my first year out of uni. I know some people do this job for a couple of years then go straight to the bar. I'm curious on the merits of that route, or if there's a more advisable route.
For reference, I'd like to practice across a broad variety of areas, including crim, employment/labour law, general common law (personal injury, wills/estates, others).
Currently I'm a commercial associate. Would it be worth trying to do another year as an associate to a common law or crime judge, or is my time better served getting a year or two experience as a solicitor? If I was to go the solicitor route I'd probably be trying to work in plaintiff law, or maybe in legal aid (but don't want to shoehorn myself in to crim-only).

An LLB has a significantly higher workload than anything offered at TAFE. And one of the early hazards of the LLB is that it requires self-discipline and self-direction. No one will care if you don't do the readings and go on to fail.
Essentially, you want strong fundamentals in order to succeed in studying law. If you didn't complete year 12, you'll likely have not been taught those fundamental skills or had much chance to hone them.
That isn't to say it's impossible. And there will be some smaller schools that will absolutely take your money and let you have a shot at law. But just recognise that you'll have ground to make up next to your peers, and may find yourself needing to work harder for the same result.

It usually involves a decent amount of reading and writing, so if you find that to be an area that you are strong in I would encourage to give it a go. I personally did not do legal studies in high school and focused on the sciences so in comparison it’s a very unique type of studying.

Ok_Sale_5632,"Career Advice Request – International Lawyer Transitioning to Australia
Hi everyone! I’d love some career advice.
I’m a Brazilian-qualified lawyer with nearly 10 years of experience in restructuring and insolvency law. I currently work remotely for a bank in Brazil, focusing on debt restructuring.
I recently moved to Melbourne with my partner and I’m on a 482 visa, which allows me to work full-time in Australia.
Now, I’m looking for the best way to transition my legal career and eventually work as a lawyer here.
I’ve been considering two main options:
Study a Juris Doctor (JD) – a 3-year degree that costs around $150,000 AUD. It seems like a great path, but it’s very expensive for me right now.
Pursue admission through the LPAB (Legal Profession Admission Board) – This involves studying the Priestley 11 subjects, completing Practical Legal Training (PLT), and then applying for admission to practice. This path is much more affordable (about $23,000 AUD total), but I’m not sure how competitive I would be in the job market with this route alone.
So my questions are:
Is it possible for a foreign-qualified lawyer to find a job in a law firm or bank without doing a JD, but by following the LPAB/PLT route?
Is it realistic to find work in restructuring and insolvency without having studied at a prestigious university in Melbourne?

PastAd5443,"I’m a recent law grad trying to figure out which area of law to pursue — I know I want to work with people, and I’m drawn to areas like employment, family, or criminal law.
Right now, I’m clerking at a Magistrates’ Court where I mainly assist in civil chambers. It’s been great for understanding civil procedure, and I’ve had the opportunity to help edit draft decisions, which has been interesting. The mentors are genuinely lovely and supportive. Initially, when I took the job I didn't have a preference for clerking in civil or criminal as I wasn’t sure what area of law to focus on. That said, I’ve found the criminal courtrooms to have piqued my interest. I haven’t been exposed to much criminal law prior to this and want to try it before it’s too late.
I’ve just been offered an associateship in the criminal division of a higher court, starting in a month. It’s an incredible opportunity to gain exposure to complex criminal matters, but I haven’t been in my current role for very long, and I’m worried I haven’t given it enough of a chance. I also have the option to be placed on a merit list and be considered for a criminal associateship later.
Part of me thinks I should stick it out in my current role and make the most of the mentoring, especially if I end up wanting to pivot to employment law. But the other part of me is afraid of missing my window to properly try criminal law before moving forward with other areas.

If you are struggling with exams, DO PRACTICE TESTS, it is without debate the best way to go about preparing. The key difference between school is what they teach you in your tutorials (classes) in uni is actually what is on the exam, unlike school where worksheets often don't reflect the exam.
In regard to assignments, like it or not you often can't do them the night before and expect a good mark. I personally draft a rough copy about 2 weeks prior to due date and revise it consistently, its landed me good marks thus far.
I think it also goes without saying to attend all your tutorials and lectures if you are struggling.
Your WAM will only impact you if you either A) want to go into a top tier firm or B) it is so low that any firm you apply to is going to get scared (50 WAM).

I’m a 4th year associate practising in litigation. A little background, I was clerking at a firm that did solely litigation while I was at university for 4 years. After obtaining my practising certificate I went into another firm doing litigation for about 2 years. I was burnt out and thought by moving into a in house counsel role doing commercial work would help with the burnout. To some degree it did help but the work wasn’t that interesting and I missed the litigation side. So I moved back into a litigation firm.
Now I’m practising in solely in litigation at a mid size firm. It’s super fast paced and it seems like everything is needed on an urgent basis. The work always gets done. There’s little mentoring from the partners, but some from the senior associates. The firm is focused on billables and networking. When I speak to my colleagues, everyone gets excited and super happy to talk about the law, they literally love the law. I don’t. Tbh I did law because of my family - I’m a first gen lawyer. They love the bragging rights, and it’s nice to see that they’re proud.
I’ve been having these feelings where for some days I feel like I know what I’m doing and some days I feel completely stupid. It makes me feel like I don’t want to be a lawyer anymore/not cut out for it. I’m riddled with anxiety and dread going to work the next day.

Key-Assignment-9249,"I'm hoping to gain some advice/opinions on choosing a uni to do a JD and whether I should do a Masters of Health Law first.
Background: I'm in my early 30s. I've been a medical doctor for several years now. I'm sick of the system, very disappointed in our public health system and how it is run, the lack of support for medical staff of all levels, and would like to transition to something else. Whether I come back to medicine in a role that can 'make a change' is yet to be decided. I'm not sure what I want to do yet. Instead of just lingering in a state of indecision, I may as well continue to study something that might be useful.
My current thoughts: I have just completed a Foundations of Law unit, and found it very interesting. I did this because I'm considering doing a Masters of Health Law. Now i'm thinking of doing a JD. (A JD instead of bachelors because more seem to be available as online only, and the overall duration will be shorted. A bachelors of Law is not out of the question). At this stage I'm not fussed about getting the best grades, or any kind of vanity associated with this field of study, I just want to knowledge.
I plan on studying part time, and continuing to work. I've not yet decided how this will look. (50/50 split the year or work and study contiguously)
Question for the audience:
Any thoughts on your universities - the quality of education, level of support, culture? (Culture is important, I really wanted to do Masters of Health Law through Melbourne, but the recent news about culture and the leaked email is putting me off)
Opinions on JD vs LLB at my level/stage in life? (I will say I found the lecturer in my foundations of law unit to be incredibly patronising, and am hoping that they may treat JD students differently, don't know how realistic this is)
Any unis that you've had experience with that have had good medically relevant electives? (I will ofc look into them myself, but I'd like to hear people's experiences)
Thoughts on doing a Masters of Health Law first vs a LLB/JD first? - I don't know if I want to become a practicing lawyer. I find the topic of law interesting, especially as it applies in our health care system. More interestingly how policy may be changed to help our patients and our staff. Hence why I'm considering Masters first. However, I am worried that I will not have the basic knowledge or skills to be able to do well at it. Though maybe if I do a Masters I will have the knowledge I want, and no longer feel the need to do a JD/LLB?
TL;DR - JD vs LLB? JD first or Masters of Health Law first? Which uni to choose?

Mysterious_Year_6266,"Have you considered instead pursuing a Masters in Public Health/Health Policy or equivalent? It seems far better suited to your goals, and with your experience, would far more likely land you in some form of policy position or sustainable employment in the long run. You don't need a legal education to enter the policy space. As a general rule and with very few exceptions, studying law is a lengthy and costly experience that is not remotely worthwhile unless you are certain you want to be a practicing lawyer. LLB/JD programs are entirely unsuitable unless this is your goal - as it is a generalist degree and offers no opportunity to 'specialise' in health/medical law (the vast majority of the degree is made up of mandatory units, with some electives, very few of which will offer what you are looking for). LLMs were historically catered towards practicing lawyers as a means to upskill or specialise and even for them, are widely considered to be a waste of time. In terms of employment, there is very little value in an LLM for a lawyer, let alone someone who is not or will not practice law. It's only been in the past decade or so that the universities have started to peddle these degrees to a broader market as a means to fleece them out of their money.
My advice would be first really figure out what it is you want to do before you commit to anything. If it is to practice law as a lawyer, an LLB or JD is a good (and mandatory) option. Where and which one to study is a complicated one, but focus on whatever is cheapest, most accessible in your circumstances, and most prestigious (in that order or priority). Note that JD fees are generally extortionate unless you get supported placements/scholarships, and grad entry LLB programs are quite rare (especially at the more prestigious law schools). On the culture front, there is really no way to pick it - as most of it will come down to who you study with. But all law schools, especially the larger ones, appear to be grappling with similar issues in their JD/post grad programs (over enrollment; high turnover of teaching staff; saturation of international students; declining quality of education etc).

As for how to approach applications, it is best to complete a few applications for firms you are less interested first. This will help develop your template CV and cover letter, and refine answers to application questions that are similar across firms. Note that most application portals allow you to save a draft application. So you may want to start your applications early-ish, and then refine and submit later in the period.

xvel0city,"Think to what you enjoyed most as a clerk. During my favourite clerkships I got involved in meaningful tasks that I could see were useful to the matter. This is compared to tasks that were just made up to keep me busy. When giving these tasks, give full context on the matter so the clerk can understand the importance of the work. After reviewing their completed work, send them back tracked changes and talk them through what they did well and what they can improve.
Also just chat to the clerk to see what they want out of the clerkship. At the start of the clerkship, grab coffee and ask them about their favourite areas of law and what they have enjoyed doing in other clerkships. Ask them if there is any type of work they want to get exposure to during the clerkship (e.g. certain area of law or sitting in meetings). Check in with them throughout the clerkship to see if anything has come up that they want to explore.
Outside of the work, include them in the social aspects of the firm. Bring them along to the morning coffee runs, lunch catch ups or after work social events (where appropriate of course).

OkAge3704,"Hi,
Throwaway acc
I am a penultimate LLB/Bcom student at the University of Auckland. I have recently accepted an offer to summer clerk at one of the big 3 firms in Auckland - I received offers from most of the major commercial firms in NZ.
I am thinking of applying for some of the Aussie firm’s winter cohorts, but had a couple of questions.
1) My WAM is about 80 I believe, would this be too low to get in the door in Aus? I am doing honours, but understand the bar is a bit lower in NZ.
2) I have strong extra-curriculars (sport, volunteering and non-legal work experience, but no “awards” like mooting wins, etc) and will have the NZ summer clerk position on my CV - how much weight will a tier 1 firm give that vs grades?
3) Is there a list somewhere of all the firms that have winter cohorts? I’ve found some that say only summer, some that say both and some that are unclear. I understand that Sydney is pretty much exclusively summer, but Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth seem to have some winter opportunities.
I didn’t have high expectations going into NZ’s recruitment season and was pleasantly surprised to do very well - I feel like Aussie recruitment will be a humbling experience, but would greatly appreciate any insight.

Different states have different clerkship systems. In Sydney, you can do only one clerkship that runs the whole summer, and clerks almost always receive a grad offer. In other cities, clerks can do up to three clerkships (two in summer, one in winter), but it is competitive to get an offer (supposedly about 1/3 do, but you would expect them to offer more than that to account for non-acceptances).

And there is definitely a correlation between students who achieve higher marks and students who go on to become good lawyers.
Getting good grades in law at uni is still very important and should be the number 1 focus. However, my view is that grades aren’t the end of the story and some firms do place too much weight on them. I am personally far more interested in a person’s legal work experience and personality. Hence, make uni easy yourself by picking easy subjects where possible and get real world legal experience if possible.
I wouldn’t hire a university medallist to be a commercial lawyer if they have no commercial sense at all and can’t speak the same business language as my clients speak.

If I had a grad that I liked and wanted to keep, I’ll have them doing the following:
shadow me or my SAs on interesting meetings and calls
summaries of transaction documents for legal sign off letters
writing client insights for external publication
drafting simple transaction documents (eg confidentiality deed, deed of novation, deed of covenant)
simple legal due diligence (eg basic lease review, summarise registrations on a land title)
helping with CLE preparation
helping with client pitches (more so making a power point look pretty and making sure the pitch maps to the RFP)
legal research and current awareness (eg, new case drops, write a case note; new legislation, summarise for the team)

Transactions can be super fast moving and there can be a lot at stake (and lawyers aren't exactly allowed to really make mistakes) so sometimes the best way is to shadow, get exposure and start taking on more responsibilities as you go along. Grads (in bigger firms) are probably more likely do help with the administrative stuff while they learn, and then start drafting emails for the more senior staff then start getting into the simpler elements of drafting etc. It all takes time and it is crucial for the foundational stuff to be understood and developed so it'll usually follow the above steps.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1lcet1w/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Other,

That said, not all of these international firms are created equal. A&O and Bakers for example are very established in the market and they have carved out defined areas of strength due to the kind of legacy international clients they have (eg Bakers is pretty strong at Tech or Tax because these things have an international edge to it and they will essentially be serving their legacy American clients on these issues). On the other hand, firms like White & Case are pretty new to the Australian market and are aggressively building themselves out, but then again are generally focused on one particular area like project finance.
Of course these are the somewhat larger American firms here. There are very prestigious American firms in Sydney like Sidley Austin, Sullivan & Cromwell or Quinn Emanuel which are tiny and specialise in uber-niche areas (eg Sidley Austin and SullCrom would pretty much exclusively work on raising capital in the US market for Australian companies, whereas Quin pretty much exclusively does class actions which is not that niche anymore but they are quite selective in the matters they take here).

don_homer,"Culture in Sydney is pretty terrible by most accounts. There are a few teams that have a lot more ex-HDY partners that have a better culture, eg E&P, insolvency, construction. They are less cunty than the NRF incumbents or laterals. But on the whole, not a great culture.
Working hours are the same as any other major corporate law firm. Long. But how long, varies by team.
Wouldn’t put too much into the whole international opportunities thing. If I remember correctly from what I have previously read about NRF, you do 4 ‘seats’ in your grad rotations, each of 6 months, and one of which can be international. But the international one is highly competitive in each grad cohort and you’ve probably got very little chance of getting it. And from memory at least one of your seats has to be in insurance law, whether you want that or not, because they have such high turnover. Then you get gifted the title of ‘associate’ just for surviving being a shitkicking rotating grad for 2 years (most other firms only make you do that for 1 year max).
I dislike international law firms. I can’t stand the conflict issues, the bureaucracy or being controlled from another country. Give me an independent Aussie firm with strong international referral networks any day.
That said, in terms of work quality, NRF is one of the better internationals in Sydney imo. They’re actually full service, unlike some of the newer entrants eg White & Case or A&O Shearman.

I’m a recent law graduate (July 2025) and would really appreciate some advice from past grads or lawyers, especially those working in or familiar with criminal law or government graduate pathways.
Due to awkward timing with my mid-year graduation, I’ve applied for 2026 grad roles, including:
AFP Legal Stream
ADF Policy and Corporate Stream
I’m currently waiting to hear back from both in August. I studied a Bachelor of Laws (Honours) at Monash but didn’t apply for any clerkships during uni, I knew corporate law wasn’t for me. Instead, I’ve had a strong interest in criminal law (Plan A), and if that doesn’t work out, family law (Plan B).
Right now, I don’t have any offers from law firms for 2026 because I didn’t take the traditional clerkship route. So, I’m wondering:
Is going down the government pathway (AFP or ADF) a suitable or strategic choice if I want to eventually work in criminal law?
If I don’t receive offers from either of those programs, what’s the best way to break into criminal law without clerkship experience? Should I commence my PLT in September on my own?
Would experience in a policy/government legal role (like ADF) be viewed as relevant or helpful for transitioning into criminal or family law later on if I take on that graduate position?
On a side note, I’m also on the merit pool for an Associate to a Judge position, which I would choose over everything if it comes through, but that’s not guaranteed at this stage.
Any thoughts, personal experiences, or advice would be massively appreciated!

Due to some fails from 2022-2023, 4 in total, my wam dropped quite severely and after those years I have averaged around 68 but my wam is stuck at 58 now and I will probably graduate with a 61-64 Wam due to my fails. I have 9 months of legal experience with barristers, 5 months of experience with the government, I have competed in national and international competitions and have been in leadership positions for the law society at uni and started a uni led law review as its Editor in chief amongst other uni extra curricular activities.
I am wondering if finishing with a 61-64 wam next year will leave me with any employment prospects. I also want to start working as a paralegal at any firm that will take me both paid and unpaid.

I built up sooo much anxiety worrying about not being able to get a job, constantly worrying about my friends in law school who had already obtained part time paralegal jobs etc.
I applied for maybe 20 jobs in my last year of law school, everything from paralegal to graduate, legal analyst etc. I think I got maybe 5-8 interviews. The week I graduate law school 1 of these turned into a job (graduate) which I took and I couldn't be happier. A piece of advice: 'it is not a race'.
If you want to be a lawyer bad enough, it will happen - apply, apply, apply and be so good in the interview that you make up for academic shortfalls.

Instead a cover letter should have a professional tone. Think about how you would write to a client if you were a lawyer. The cover letter also presents an opportunity for the reviewer to assess your written abilities (which is a requisite skill of the profession). It should be logically structured and wrote clearly and concisely.
Your cover letter should focus on relating your experiences and skills to what the firm states they are looking for and the commonly understood qualities of a proficient lawyer (e.g. time management, team work, legal writing / research). Your formatting should be easily readable to assist the reader to identify relevant experiences and skills - they will likely skim it.

I am unsure what to do for my second rotation. I have never really done transactional work so I’m thinking of giving it a go. I have no interest in property and the firms corporate team is quite small so I’m thinking b&f or construction. The construction team does both front and back end work.

Few_External_4282,Speaking to some people within the firm b&f seems more aligned to my interests. I did a construction elective at uni which was interesting.

don_homer,"Yes, property at uni is incredibly boring. I’m a property lawyer, and even I hated it at uni.
In practice, it’s a very interesting area of law because it covers a lot of different areas, including contract, equity, corporations law, trusts, taxes and duties, and foreign investment. You need to know your way around a lot of legislation and a huge suite of transaction documents and models.
Property lawyers at big firms can also do project work, which can include development projects such as roads, rail, hospitals, renewable energy, etc - in which case you’re also working with construction contracts and concepts related to construction. That is also work that construction lawyers can do (ie the upstream agreement and downstream to construction contractors, or just the latter). I do this work and I’m effectively a hybrid property and construction lawyer.
So, if I were you, I wouldn’t totally rule it out. I personally think that there is more variety in property law at a big firm compared to construction law. Construction law is basically just contract law with different contracting models, and a sprinkling of statute. With that said, construction law is still great transactional work (IMO) and if you already have an interest in it then that could be the way to go.
With B&F, you could also have the opportunity to settle in a property finance or project finance sub-team. In which case you’re working on the finance arrangements for large property deals and large construction projects. Perhaps a way to combine some of your interests. Interesting work. Can be long hours, particularly if dealing with international financiers or clients.

What do you think the reasoning for this is? Are there any inherent advantages to doing so?",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1ltfy54/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Programs,
AdvancedPear,"In Sydney, I don't think that's right — if anything, the major commercial floors seem to have slightly shifted their preferences towards more experienced readers (eg, SA-level), although there are still a lot of readers who have only spent one or two years in practice, plus some time as an associate.
Going to the bar literally straight out of law school will almost always be a bad idea, because the chances of getting a position as a reader on a good floor, with enough work to support a practice, are very low. But if you really want to go to the bar, and you have enough on your CV to get a position at a floor with a lot of good work going around (eg, in Sydney, Eleven, Banco, Six, New, Ten, Seven, etc.), then there is no point delaying any longer than it takes to get a spot as a reader. Yes, you will learn a lot that is relevant to practice at the bar as a solicitor, but you will learn more about being a barrister, and more quickly, by being a barrister. Going earlier may mean that the first years at the bar are more stressful — but they are likely to be stressful and demanding anyway. IMO the marginal difference is not great.
The inherent advantage of going earlier — again, assuming you can get onto a floor that will help you to build a practice — is that you will be a barrister for longer. In the long run, it probably doesn't matter, but two or three extra years at the bar makes a meaningful difference in the medium term. Also, assuming that we are talking about people who are looking to read on a floor with lots of commercial work going around, you will probably have earned two or three times (or more) what a solicitor of comparable vintage would have been earning over that time.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1ltfy54/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Applications,

About to do the ‘normal’ advertisement for a grad for mid tier but realised that instead of asking the boomers in HR I should probably ask the actual people I may want to hire what they look for in a firm. I don’t care about grades so much. I would rather hire a credit average and someone who worked in hospitality than a HD average who never had to work throughout uni. Have pedantic clients who care about grammar (eg change where commas are in submissions - and they can be wrong FFS). Pay will be higher end of the band and firm will pay for plt with clawback provision. I need street smart that can write. Not necessarily academia smart. What can a firm offer you newbies that would differentiate the advertisement from all the other grad roles out there? What is it that would attract you? If you say WLB can you give some definition of what you mean by that? That you will always be able to leave at 5 and never work from home? Absolutely no criticism - just genuinely curious to get intel on what WLB means to the new cohort of lawyers coming through.

Comfortable-Roll-770,"I'm currently working on an assessment that requires AGLC referencing. The task sheet specifies that only full references are required in the bibliography, and notes that ""full citations are not necessary within footnotes, provided the footnote accurately links to the sources referred to in the bibliography.""

Unfortunately, I’m unable to clarify this with my teacher, so I was hoping someone here could help. When making pinpoint references in the footnotes, should I include a comma after the case name before the page or paragraph number (i.e. Party A v Party B, 345), or should the pinpoint reference follow directly after the case name without a comma (i.e. Party A v Party B 345)?

There is a cost to sponsor someone for employment for a period of longer than 6 months. From memory, it's around $10k. The position also has to be advertised on two job boards and must result in no suitable local candidates being found - probably a pretty high bar to clear for most practice areas at the moment.
Most firms don't want to hire foreign qualified lawyers for those reasons, particularly at the junior level where there is quite a lot of local talent available.

On lender side, you might be giving advice on what security the financier might want to obtain over the borrower or its assets to be comfortable granting the loan. You would also typically generate all of the loan documentation and negotiate it (assuming a business borrower) with the borrower’s lawyer. If there is an existing financier with security over the borrower or its assets, you might also negotiate with the existing financier how priority of security will be sorted out if one financier calls in their debt, or the conditions on which the existing securities will be released.
You might also undertake advisory and compliance work for lenders, as the laws around financial services are quite complex and frequently changing.
On borrower side, you’d probably be giving a bit of advice on potential structuring options for their debt package and then negotiating the terms of the loan documents with the lender and other existing financiers.
With international clients you might also be working with financiers and lawyers in other jurisdictions.
There’s a lot of different types of finance out there. B&F lawyers can be jacks of all trades, but in the bigger firms they tend to specialise in one particular area.

If you use AI to literally do this work for you, you don't ever engage with the foundational concepts in the law sufficiently to understand them. So you can't properly explain them to another person or answer questions about them. So you don't develop the ability to solve the problem.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1iauggk/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Interviews,

I am good at what I do and have constantly received praises from my bosses over the last 2 years for being capable beyond their expectations and for being advanced for my level of experience. Nevertheless, I simply don't want to do it anymore.
I'm now in civil litigation and always have been in and around litigation. The job now is far too stressful and I simply don't enjoy anything beyond intellectual exercises such as research and advice. Even those seem cumbersome when I have so much else to get done. It seems like all I do is fall at the whims of our clients and put out fires for them every single day. I'm not getting anything out of it and the only thing I'm getting is completely burnt out.
For context, I also work at a smaller firm. My experience over the last 2 years has been focused on working at well-reputed boutiques. They have both been very different boutiques (one focused on corporate law run by an ex-partner at a top-tier international firm and my current firm is a well-known community based firm that does just about everything). I have never had trouble getting a job I want as I have great grades and a good resume. I know I don't want to work in big law (never did the clerkships thing either).
My plan was to wait it out for a couple of years to gain some practical experience and money before moving on to do a PHD and going down the academic route. I know this is my end goal. I don't want to go on that path before I'm steady enough to do so and there are some external circumstances which dictate that I will need to wait at least two or three years from now to do this.

EggplantOk3701,"Guaranteed JD at Unimelb vs Law/Commerce at Monash
Hey everyone, so most people recommend going to Monash over unimelb for law due to the fact that it is guaranteed, but I am eligible for the graduate degree pathway which would give me a guaranteed place in the JD. I'm currently torn between the two so answers to any of these questions would mean a lot.
Working overseas
The consensus definitely seems to be that the JD would be better for international opportunities, which is something I am interested in. However, I'm wondering how it logisitcally gives you an advantage. For example, it seems like aus lawyers tend to move overseas only after 2-3 years of work experience, so by that time how much does your uni dictate your ability to move overseas or is it mainly what firm you get into? And also, if you get into an international firm do they facilitate long term/more permanent overseas moves (in that case I would probably just go to Monash and aim to get into a good firm after graduation). Or if I did the JD, is the distinction that there would be opportunities to work overseas straight after graduation? Basically just wanting to know how exactly the JD would allow me to move overseas beyond the fact that it is more internationally recognised.
Prestige
I have heard that in Australia, Monash and Unimelb are considered equally by employers. However, my parents would rather me go to unimelb as they believe the prestige will give me an edge in terms of career opportunities, and it seems that the JD has a very high rate of people getting full time employment after grad. Do any of you have experience/thoughts on whether going to unimelb genuinely can give you an edge?
Arts vs Commerce at Unimelb
If I was to choose unimelb, my plan was always to choose commerce but recently I've been looking into an arts degree with a major in economics and politics. Most of the JD candidates seem to be from arts degrees, and if I were to take commerce I'd be worried about being behind in terms of essay writing and critical analysis skills. However, I have also considered that having a degree in commerce and strong knowledge in that area could give me an advantage when applying to corporate law firms, so I am interested to see if anyone experienced has any thoughts on this!
Additional points - public transport to Monash would be much easier (melb would be a 1 hour commute) and I also think I prefer the vibe of Monash more which is why I am leaning more towards it. Given the competitiveness to get into the JD and its prestige it is hard to pass up the opportunity though so if anyone has answers to these questions it would be greatly appreciated!",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1iauggk/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Applications,
horsehasbolted,"There's really no reason to choose Melbourne over Monash, unless you want to go for reasons outside the degrees themselves (living at Melbourne's colleges, joining specific clubs or for living/personal reasons).
If you look up lawyers who've made the move overseas, there are just as many from Monash as there are from Melbourne. The main factor is getting into a decent firm and transferable practice area.
There's really no difference in prestige between the two, you'll have a relatively consistent split between the two in terms of grads at firms, your grades and extra-curriculars will be what sets you apart.
Study what you enjoy, at the end of the day firms will largely only be interested in your law grades. There might be some limited benefit of doing a more technical degree like science or engineering if you are interested in going into IP or IT related law, but it isn't critical.
Separately, it's not clear what guaranteed spot you have - is it a CSP or FFP? If it's FFP then you'd be crazy not to go to Monash as your total fees will be close to $100k more at Melbourne. Even if it's a CSP you're still looking at additional fees given you will need to do more units over two separate degrees at Melbourne as opposed to a double degree at Monash. In addition, I understand you also have minimum grade requirements to maintain your guaranteed JD place (although they shouldn't be too difficult to meet).
Finally, while some people say they prefer the flexibility of doing an undergrad first and then a postgrad law degree, this doesn't take into account that you need a minimum of 6 years to finish an undergrad and JD at Melbourne, whereas you can finish a double degree at Monash in 5 years (you could also extend by a semester and spend half a year travelling and still finish at the same time as people going to Melbourne).",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1iauggk/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Locations,
No_Control8031,"The JD costs more money but you can say you have an AQF level 9 qualification which is one higher than an LLB. In real terms this is completely meaningless as the content is the same and you start back at the bottom in terms of being a lawyer. I’d go the combined law route quite frankly. Straight law is hard to get around even with a degree under your belt. Monash is a top university and closer to your home.
I am biased because I did an arts degree but there’s more options. You can study economics subjects if you want. Once you become a lawyer nobody is concerned about whether you did an arts degree or commerce degree.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1iauggk/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Other,
Immediate-Garlic8369,"Congrats on getting good results and giving yourself some options.
You can't really go wrong with either choice. I based my decision to go to Melbourne largely on the commute and probably would have gone to Monash if the commutes were reversed.
In terms of working overseas, the JD is maybe only beneficial for the US, because it aligns with the degrees their lawyers compete. But really, there's plenty of opportunities for Australian lawyers around the world regardless of whether they've completed a JD.
In terms of prestige, they're viewed basically identically in recruitment, so don't let that sway your decision.
One advantage of the JD is that you do get 3 years of uni to prepare for it before you start (and also get the opportunity to mature and think about whether you really want to do a law degree). But a disadvantage is that you're doing straight law (I found that harder than being able to take breaks from my political studies by doing economics). Those were personal pros / cons, but you might view those differently.
In terms of Arts v Commerce, just do whichever one you think you'll enjoy more, as it'll be easier for you to do something you're passionate about and you'll probably get better marks. I don't really know any corporate lawyers who mention how beneficial their Arts or Commerce degree is to their job (not to say there aren't benefits from the general skills you'll learn in both!).

RobbieBeta01,"Hi folks. Am a final year law student. Spent nearly a year at a CLC (as an intern than paralegal) before moving to a regional firm.
Am a bit over six months in now. The partner I report to is a great bloke.
However, I've been doing a lot of work with a young lawyer 3-4yr PAE who is doing my head in. Long-story short, when she explains instructions, she takes forever to tell me anything (once she spent 2.5 hours writing an email with instructions). Because she is telling me so much at once when she is giving me instructions (including the history of how forms have changed at court), I have been struggling to remember exactly what she's been telling me. Have gotten yelled at by her for looking in the wrong place for something she apparently told me in one of these mammoth instruction sessions (once again, was my first time doing the task).
In our client file database I have figured out that she has been looking at the work I have been doing (even in matters she is not involved in) by searching my profile. Have had a couple of blistering emails from her about the work I have done in files she has not been working on (the partner which we both report to has not said anything, in one case I copped it for following his instructions EXACTLY). I have also noticed that these emails have not been saved to file by her (firm policy is to save every single piece of correspondence to file).

catch-10110,"The problem with questions like this is hidden under the surface is the question ""do I have an ethics problem""? (I include in that questions like PC restrictions and supervision).
I don't mean to be discouraging. Unlike some requests for advice on this sub I don't think this should be locked or this question forbidden. It's entirely appropriate (and to be encouraged) to seek out advice from peers on ethical issues. It's one of the great things about a collegiate profession.
The problem is you don't know anything about anyone here so it will be hard to take answers very seriously.
So my advice would be to first think about why you are asking this question. Are you concerned about pay and seniority and career progression, or ethical (including supervision) issues, or both? That will help you figure out what you're really trying to ask.
Even better advice would be to approach a trusted more senior friend, colleague or acquaintance-colleague and ask them. You could even call a barrister you have previously briefed - a good 95% of the Bar would love to help you figure out this kind of thing in my experience.
For what its worth, for a talented junior in a good firm with a good supportive and attentive partner and SA's I would think the kind of work you're talking about is appropriate in the right circumstances. At a minimum there should be strict and well managed guide wires and safety nets. For example this could be appropriate in low risk non-complex matters where the SA or Partner are very closely involved and settle your work before it goes out (practically mandatory if you are restricted).
On the other hand if the partner or SA just hands you a folder of precedents and an annotated corps act and says figure it out, you're in deep mate.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1cw25r3/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Interviews,

I was wondering what kind of law you practice and what your actual work looks like so I can do some more research into specific areas to see what I might be interested in.
My favourite parts of legal studies was reading over things and analysing stuff, I think. I remember particularly enjoying a write-up we did on a hypothetical civil case, arguing both sides and coming to a conclusion based on facts, existing legislation, and precedent was very fun.
If I did law I wouldn’t want to do criminal law or go to court or things like that, I think I’d be more interested in paperwork and contacts or something, but It’s hard to know when my only experience is a year 10 subject.

This may not be applicable in all States but at least in WA, part time work requires prior approval of the Board to count towards SLP (even though it is prorated). I imagine most firms just don’t want the hassle factor (at least in States with that requirement). It’s a shame, I think.
I am constantly seeing posts on LinkedIn about this or that firm embracing “NewLaw” flexible ways of working. It might be worth doing some targeted networking through people who are being vocal on this topic. Ask if you can bring them some afternoon tea and ask for any suggestions on how to find part time roles. Some people are quite passionate about flexibility so may want to help!
Otherwise only other thing I can think of is to apply for full time roles but ask if a compressed 4 day week (still full time) would be an option, to avoid 5 days of daycare. Still very hard as a new mum, I realise.

goldilocks797,"Postgrad law student amidst an existential crisis!
Hey all!
Seeking advice!
Long held dream to do medicine but missed out following high school and pursued a Bachelor of Midwifery instead
I’ve worked as midwife for the past ~four years post undgrad. I’m passionate but also feel unfulfilled in the sense that I practice all the skills I‘m able to as a midwife (suturing etc) + my desire to learn / do more is deep. I can’t foresee myself remaining as a midwife as a career - I want more challenge / stimulation / skills.
Currently studying at UniMed JD. Main concerns there are whether I will actually end up enjoying practice. I’m not enjoying the content in first year at all & am deeply questioning whether I will enjoy practice. I’ve read lots of forums re not enjoying law school but enjoying practice. I’m not feeling engaged with the content in the JD and my decision to continue is based on financially rationally / back -up plan. It seems a very hard slog to finish the JD with the above and below in mind.
There is a malaise / sadness about studying law at the moment when I hold a dream to study med. I find myself peeping at med student powerpoints / lectures that sit next to me whilst studying in the library.
Why law? Conceptual ideas about some areas that may interest me with the ultimate goal to use law as a vehicle for change / help others —> intelligence, international relations/arbitration + negotiation/politics orrrr Coroner’s Court.
Considerations
Firstly, am I bloody mad?
Will I actually enjoy working in the legal space post grad? Rhetorical question but deeply questioning what area of law may be of interest. I’ve spoken with friends in the commercial legal space but it doesn’t interest me from my brief exposure.
I have a part scholarship to complete the JD however will still be saddled with debt
Sticking with law offers greater financial renumeration than being a midwife ever will. Do I continue with law so that if med doesn’t work out, I have a career that will support me more financially into the future? I have financial savings from other passive streams but it stings to know I have very limited financial growth as a midwife.
I’m 26 and feel an expectation to ‘find’ a new career, commit & progress. Fallen into law for the breadth of areas & financial renumeration and dare I say ’professional identity‘?",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1cqlqyw/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Offers & Rejections,

The areas of law you are looking at likely aren’t going to net you more than an ambitious midwife could get if they set their mind to upskilling and moving up.
If you want to study Med, find a pathway to study Med. There are enough people studying law who really want to be lawyers and who love the content who will hate the reality of practice after a few years and drop the profession altogether.
If you are constantly looking over other people’s shoulders because you want to study Med, that’s is unlikely to go away when you actually become a lawyer and you may find yourself back and studying 10 years from now with far more significant financial burdens to consider.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1cqlqyw/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Other,

Aggravating_Grape939,"Hi all, Just wanted some general career opinions to give some perspective on whether I’m being ungrateful in my current situation. Long story short I work for a multi billion dollar company as in house counsel. We run a lean team and the previous general counsel departed the business around a year ago, in their absence I have been reporting to the CEO/company secretary for the past year and for all intents and purposes have filled that role. I am aware of what the previous general counsel was making (it was market rate for where I live), the previous GC had ten more PAE years than myself. I have recently been told my raise by the CEO, it is around 50k less than what the previous GC was on (and below market considering they were on what would be considered market). His excuse was that it’s a good salary for my age (I’m 29) and that my career path is in that direction anyway. Not to be bias but general feedback from stakeholders within the business is that my work has been more efficient and the interactions easier compared to the last GC. Question is, am I justified in being a little irritated, or does the 10 year PAE warrant that much of a pay difference? Noting that I am doing literally the exact same role as the previous GC and managing the same team and workflow? Is there anyway to broach this? Or should I just be grateful that I’m on an enviable career path and do my time?",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1cqlqyw/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Salaries,

Is 10 extra PAE worth more? Yes.
Is it worth $50k more? That depends. $200k vs $250k is very different to $100k vs $150k. A better question would be either - what’s the market rate, or what value are you bringing to the business?
A middle ground could be taking on the GC title without the extra pay, if it’s really true that you are doing the exact same job. Being a GC opens doors to other GC roles, the first one is the hardest to get. But also once you take the step-up in title it will look strange if you apply for “lesser” titles roles so it’s a double edged sword.
Are you on a good track either way? Yes it sounds like it.

I am currently torn between a JD and a Master of Laws (Human Rights Law and Policy), the latter of which I am eligible for enrolment in as per the course outline on UNSW's website. My areas of interest are in Human Rights Law, International Law, Public Interest Law, Discrimination Law, Employment Law, and Constitutional Law.
The Master of Laws is more specialised towards my areas of interest, but it is only one year long and will not give me the full breadth of legal knowledge, and won't qualify me as a lawyer in case I want to practice. I am not interested in practicing commercial or corporate law, which is why I am thinking of doing this one-year program.

hunglingyiu,"Hi all,
I am a PR with a Chinese background. I studied LLB in the UK, worked as a full-time paralegal in Hong Kong for a couple months, and recently completed my graduate diploma at Monash (I’ve finished my units but haven’t received my final grade or transcript yet)
I have been applying for legal roles since December as I near the end of my diploma. I have submitted over 50 applications, but I am getting either rejected or ghosted. The only interview I got was for an unpaid intern role at a Chinese firm, which I am currently working at. However, I really want to get a paid full-time job to support myself financially. I also plan to complete my PLT this year and get admitted afterwards.
A few questions I would like to ask:
1.    How difficult is it for a non-local with no Australian work experience to get a legal job? I have seen previous posts mentioning entry-level lawyers in Australia being saturated, is that the same for other legal roles?
2.    Is it worth applying for roles that requires ‘a minimum X years of experience’? I feel like they would reject me instantly.
3.    Are there any roles that I should focus on when applying? I’m open to work in any practice area.
4.    How can I increase my chances of getting hired by a Western firm? I am considering cold-emailing and inviting people to have coffee chats. Would finishing my PLT help, or should I continue working in Chinese firms and transition later?
5.    Since my plan this year is to get a full-time job, should I look for work in another industry and switch back to legal after finishing PLT? My mentor at Monash suggested me starting in entry-level roles at banks like NAB and try moving to their legal department/switch to a law job, is that reasonable? What other jobs besides banking should I consider?
Any advice is appreciated!",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1ilt1tr/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Applications,
sunflower-days,"If you're non-local with no Australian experience, your chances of getting hired are not great, even relative to other grads. 
It's not that people are blatantly racist; the majority of people in Australia are very welcoming and friendly and that's part of the reason why people migrate here. It's just that some people are very ignorant about the rest of the world, and they can be apprehensive about hiring you if it might be difficult to do so (either due to sponsorship/visa issues or mismatch with existing workplace culture).
I assume what you mean by 'Chinese firm' = the type of firm that only hires ethnic Chinese who've recently migrated, like you. This is because you are likely to be unaware that if you are doing work that is being billed to the client, it's probably illegal for the firm not to pay you (pls get advice or contact the Fair Work Ombudsman about this), and it is therefore easy for them to exploit you. 
It's not worthwhile to stay with this sort of firm. The standard of their training is about the same as the standard of their compliance with workplace laws. Other firms will know this and will not want to hire you.
To improve your chances of finding a job:
Become a member of the AALA and go to some of their events. Talk to people there. Contact people listed in their staff directory to meet up. Many of the lawyers in that organisation will have faced the same challenges as you, and may be willing to help. Meet in person, so they get a chance to assess your personality. 
Put it on you CV on page 1, prominently, if you're PR.
Make no spelling or grammatical errors in your CV, cover letters or emails. 
If you can tolerate it, choose an English name and use it instead of your Chinese one. I hate that I have to suggest this, but doing this alone can massively increase the number of call-backs you get in Australia. This has been tested and proven.
Good luck 🍀",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1ilt1tr/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Applications,

I’m currently in the glut of applying for entry level paralegal/admin roles to try and get some law experience under my belt before grad roles open up at the end of the year. I have a decade long career in arts administration but don’t have any legal work experience to my name.
I’m finding it difficult to pierce through the noise and land interviews so I’m looking for any advice as to some traps I may be falling into without realising. In my most recent interview I was told that I was likely overqualified for the role before being told that they gave the role to someone who had paralegal experience. Simultaneously over and under qualified.
I don’t really have any familial connections at law firms that I can lean on and it seems to be something that’s really holding me back. There are transferrable skills from my career to these entry level roles but it feels like every paralegal gig I apply for is expressly looking for people who already have paralegal experience.
I’m wondering whether I need to do something as extreme as quit my job and volunteer at legal aid for a while to just make sure I have some experience to my name before August/September? Is it worth me just starting my PLT now and copping the expense so that I have another qualification on my CV?

McTerra2,"Most firms, even top ones, do not have a very high automatic cut off (as in, if you are not just all pass marks and dont have many fails you will be put into the second look pile). However, when they look at someone with low marks against someone with higher marks, unless the person with low marks has some truly outstanding other advantage, the low marks will be the distinguishing factor.
Given that 90%+ of grads are much the same (went to school, got high marks, have a part time job, have done community service or moots or spend every friday helping blind disabled wombats cross the road), there are only fairly minor distinctions between candidates outside of their marks. And hence the marks become the differentiator and by default it ends up with most people needing to have good marks to get an interview.
For the majority people its the same practical result as having an automatic minimum cut off. However, if you are in that 10% (or 5%) of applicants who do have something that makes them really stand out from the crowd (olympics or previous full time job experience or whatever) then you can 'overcome' the marks issue.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1ilt1tr/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Interviews,

One thing I will say about AGS is that it is very easy to become isolated as it can be uncommon to work with team members in the same state/territory as you.
That said, I think AGS is a very good stepping stone or taste test of government/inhouse. You still have most of the structural set up of private practice (billables etc) with less pressure.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1ilt1tr/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Locations,
Acrobatic-Food-5202,"Thank you for your response!
What’s the general nature of practice like compared to private practice at eg top tier or mid tier? Honestly one thing I want more of eventually is getting stuck into actual legal practice and not doing hours of dry doc review and being a glorified case manager. I’ve had some experience in state govt practice and know it’s a lot more involved (less people working matters so you get more responsibility, you start drafting your own advices much earlier in your career etc) but I know that Commonwealth might be different as it is a much larger bureaucracy.
Also, is it a good stepping stone to the bar? I imagine if it involves more of what I mention above it would be, keen to know general views on this.

Rhybrah,"I have never worked for a top or mid tier, so I can't make that comparison for you.

I think it is a decent stepping stone. A fair few of my colleagues have recently gone to the bar after careers of various lengths. There's also a few AGS alumni kicking about at the bar and on the bench e.g. Logan J and Jacqueline Gleeson J, Trent Glover SC at the Sydney Bar.
I'm not entirely familiar with the Melbourne office as I've only ever been there once so can't really speak to the social aspect of the office.
When I mentioned isolation, I was more meaning that, at least in my experience, due to the national practice model can result in you not working as often with lawyers in the same office as you might in other firms.

EnvironmentalBid5011,"This is going to be controversial, but in my experience Victorian lawyers and especially Victorian govt lawyers are much weaker than their NSW and WA counterparts in terms of legal skills and knowledge.
I am a criminal defence lawyer and I work in the NT. We get people from all over, but mostly from Victoria. I think 7 years PAE in Melbourne is equivalent to: 5 in rural Vic 4 in Sydney or Canberra 3 in rural WA 2 in rural NSW
My reasons are: a unique political and legal climate in Victoria = more barristers doing the real advocacy and solicitors being glorified case managers. It’s not just that Victorians don’t have the same opportunities to practice their advocacy, it’s also that they never single-handedly run a defended matter to its conclusion, so their tactical skills and “broad picture” understanding is also lacking, and they’re much more conservative on plea advice l, erring on the side of pleading punters up even when they lawfully could not be convicted.

EducationalWeb1387,"In transactional practice areas, is commerce preferred over arts?
Among transactional lawyers, commerce (majoring in finance or accounting) seems to be more prevalent than arts as a double-degree accompaniment to law. I’m wondering if this is the product of a conscious preference by firms, or alternatively, whether it’s due to applicant self-selection (i.e., arts graduates choosing to go into transactional practice areas less frequently than commerce graduates).
For instance, if a student wants to complete a clerkship rotation in Banking & Finance, would firms perceive commerce as more desirable than arts (and prefer commerce grads) for that Banking & Finance rotation?
If a general preference for commerce over arts exists in transactional law, does it apply to the same extent for all transactional practice areas (M&A, project finance, private equity, etc.)?

Mean_Cryptographer87,"low wam student here (67 law-only, 75 law/arts), still have 11 law units to complete and want to bring that average up.
Limited experience/extra-curriculars as it was heavily discouraged in my household (immigrant boomer parents, different mindset), instead wanted me to solely focus on school. Had a few semesters where I really struggled with mental health and burnout that consequently tanked my grades, but I'm trying to change now.
I did an internship through uni that helped me realise I really like doing actual work, and got great feedback from the team. Maybe I'm just a weak student?
I guess I'm just looking for some motivation or study tips from real lawyers. What things should I prioritise at uni and in my personal life to give me the best chances at success? Realistically, is it fruitless to aim for 'biglaw'? Can I get to top tier firms after working at a mid/low tier eventually (if I don't get those grades up)?",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1jidmta/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Other,
Mean_Cryptographer87,"Without knowing you personally, it’s hard to say whether you’ll end up in BigLaw — personality traits, mindset, and work ethic are all massive parts of the puzzle. But I will say this: you’re absolutely not out of the game.
Starting out at a smaller or mid-tier firm can actually fast-track your development. You’ll likely get hands-on experience earlier, be running files one or two years PAE, and really build your practical skill set. That kind of exposure makes you a more attractive lateral hire down the track — whether that’s to a mid-tier, top-tier, or even in-house role.
A lot of students get really hung up on the prestige of the firm — the name, the brand, the shiny logo on the letterhead. But here’s a better metric: focus on the quality of the individuals you’re learning from. Some of the most knowledgeable, experienced lawyers — former senior partners from top-tier firms — now work in smaller practices as they wind down their careers. In that kind of environment, you’re more likely to get genuine mentorship and one-on-one time, rather than just passing those people in the hallway at a top-tier firm.
You’re clearly self-aware, and you’re taking action to course-correct — that’s huge. You’ve still got 11 law units left, which is a solid runway to improve your WAM. An upward trend will work in your favour. Keep pushing yourself to excel in those subjects, and make sure you’re also picking up practical experience wherever possible — whether it’s internships, volunteering, or legal clinics. These not only help your resume but also boost your confidence.
Also, don’t underestimate your story. You’ve had setbacks, dealt with mental health challenges, and you’re still standing and trying to improve. That resilience matters. Firms care about grades, yes, but they also care about character, growth, and self-awareness. You’re not a weak student — you’re someone who’s still finding their feet.
If you’re passionate and competent, you can get to BigLaw. Whether you’ll still want to be there after a few years in the profession is another question entirely — and a valid one. Yes, the money might be higher, but the lifestyle and values might not align with you long-term.
At the end of the day, just focus on being the very best version of yourself — as a student, as a colleague, as a future practitioner. The rest will follow.

Mean_Cryptographer87,"Hey, solid question — and the short answer is yes, you can move into BigLaw from a mid or boutique firm. It’s not uncommon at all. Just for context, I haven’t worked in BigLaw myself, but I’ve been offered roles by top-tier firms and have spent time figuring out what they look for in lateral hires — especially coming from smaller firms.
At this stage, your GPA isn’t a big deal unless it’s unusually high or low. Firms are much more interested in your practical experience — how well you draft, whether you can manage parts of a file, take instructions, and basically contribute without needing heaps of supervision. So your focus should be on becoming as competent and reliable as possible. That means doing high-quality work, learning how to problem-solve, and understanding what your supervising lawyer actually needs from you — not just what the law says.
If you get the chance to run files, appear in court, or work directly with clients, grab it. Those experiences are really valuable and make a difference when you’re applying for lateral roles. It also helps to build strong relationships with your supervisors. At smaller firms, you often work more closely with senior lawyers — if they rate you highly, they’ll give you solid references later down the track, which counts for a lot.
It also helps to specialise a bit, if you can. BigLaw firms usually hire laterals into specific practice groups, so if there’s an area you want to move into (say commercial litigation, property, construction, etc.), try to steer your work in that direction even if your current firm does a bit of everything. You want to look like a clean fit when a role opens up.
One other thing people overlook is how much quality varies within firms. Don’t get too caught up on firm size or branding right now — some boutique or mid-tier firms do top-tier level work and offer much better training. Learning from great lawyers is more important than the name on your email signature.
Finally, start building quiet connections in the industry. Go to events, CPDs, and meet other lawyers. Even just chatting with a junior lawyer at a firm you’re interested in can be helpful. A lot of lateral hires come from someone putting in a good word internally when a role opens up.
So yeah — totally doable. Focus on doing great work where you are, building your skill set, and becoming someone others want to work with. That’s the stuff that opens doors.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1jidmta/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Applications,

Mean_Cryptographer87,"Don't stress too much about the university you attend.
Your GPA of 6.5 is excellent, and firms generally use grades and university reputation as proxies to gauge potential capability. However, in reality, your future success as a graduate largely depends on your attitude, willingness to learn, and any relevant practical experience you gain along the way.
Most law graduates, regardless of GPA or the university they attended, experience a steep learning curve in practice. Excelling at university doesn't necessarily equate to excelling as a lawyer, and vice versa.
It's also worth mentioning not to overlook smaller or boutique law firms. Starting at a smaller firm can provide significant hands-on experience early in your career, which can greatly accelerate your practical skills and professional development. Personally, I began in a small firm and gained immediate exposure to meaningful work, which has significantly benefited me compared to peers who initially joined large firms and spent extensive time on document review or other menial tasks.
Ultimately, choose the university that best suits your personal circumstances and supports your ability to perform well academically while balancing your current work commitments. Your attitude, resilience, and practical experiences will matter far more in the long run.

The partners often issue the invoices before SAs get the chance and then I overhear the SAs mentioning my name and making a fuss about it...

don_homer,"It sounds like some matters are being billed with time from you that could be classified as ""training time"" and wouldn't normally be billed to the client. At the same time, SA time might be being written down (instead of your time being written down) by the partner, who isn't close to the file and doesn't understand why your time and the SA time were both high on the bill (i.e. probably because they've invested time in training you).
So the SAs are probably saying something like ""Fuck, the cap on this file was $5k, OP chewed up 3 hours on a task that I could have done in an hour. I had to spend 3 hours fixing it up, now Shithead Partner has cut my time to 0.5 and billed almost to the cap. I wish Shithead Partner had asked me before billing this month.""
As a junior, it's not your problem to sort this out. Ultimately, the partner decides what to bill and whether they want to consult with the SA on the file or not. They're the boss. If clients get shitty, or the estimate gets blown, it's on the partner. And if the SAs have a problem with what the partner is (or isn't) doing, they need to put on their big boy/girl pants and go have an adult conversation.
One thing you could do though, is ask your supervising SA how long they think the task should take you to complete. While their estimate can be hit or miss, if you get to the point where you think there is no way you can complete the task in the estimated timeframe, it's a good point to hold and ask your SA if you're on the right track, give them an update on how long you think it will take you to finish the task, and ask them if they want you to continue or change approach.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1jidmta/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Other,

You’ll have a chance at a clerkship in the sense that they may not dismiss you instantly despite your WAM since it isnt extremely low + you have good experience and some extracurriculars - also you could potentially address your lower wam in either the cover letter or interview or both. A potential concern for you would be your ability to articulate why you want to work in commercial law since you are saying you aren’t sure if you even want to practice law.

I’ve recently become very interested in pursuing an international LLM (and have lots of personal reasons for wanting to do so and am under no illusion it’ll further my career and am aware of how much it costs). But I have been utterly destroying myself inside for not doing honours in my undergrad. I had the marks for it, but just decided at the time (due to various personal life dramas) that I wouldn’t have enough energy to dedicate it. I even reached out to the Dean of my law school recently to see if there was a possibility of doing it appended but apparently it’s not something that’s offered.
This has obviously made the path to an international LLM somewhat harder. Lots of UK unis have a first class (or a high second) as a bare minimum requirement, though other countries (including US) don’t seem to care as much or at least are silent on the issue.
I’ve picked up a sessional academic gig at the Uni I studied at and plan to stick with it for at least this year. I’ve been told I should also try publishing something but I don’t even really know where to begin with that.
Has anyone here done an international LLM, especially at a more “renowned” school, without honours? And would having a year or two teaching experience, maybe a paper or two in some small journals, and having graduated in the top 10% of my class (albeit without honours) be equivalent experience to having done honours?

hunglingyiu,"Reposting from last week's thread:
1.    Does recruiters overlook on candidates with non-LLB or JD degrees? I hold a UK LLB and decided to study a graduate diploma rather than JD for time and cost considerations. When I apply for jobs, I listed the Diploma as my most recent qualification and included the LLB in my CV, and I have received no interviews. A solicitor I worked with suggested that recruiters may not recognise the Diploma. Could my academic background be causing me to be screened out? How can I show recruiters that I am as qualified as someone with an LLB or JD?
2.    When answering screening questions for job applications, if my answers do not align with the job criteria, am I likely to be screened out automatically by the algorithm or by the recruiter? Would it be more effective to email my CV directly to the recruiter? I tried before but didn't hear back and I wonder whether it is worth doing again.
3.    Is gaining experience in non-legal roles worthwhile? Previous discussions mentioned having admin or customer service experiences could be help in getting a legal job, hence I have also applied for these roles but still not having much success (although this could due to me not tailoring my law-focused CV to these roles, or recruiters think I will leave as soon as a legal opportunity comes up). I did get an interview at an accounting firm, but the firm’s principals advised me to focus on finding a legal job. They mentioned that these role would not offer the practical legal experience crucial for the legal profession. As a result, I am conflicted about whether to continue applying for non-legal jobs.
I’m currently working as an unpaid intern at a law firm. While I don’t hold an official title, I’ve been signing off external emails as ‘Legal Assistant’ during my time there. As I update my CV, I wonder would it be misleading to list my role as Legal Assistant, or should I be honest and describe myself as an Intern? I want to improve my chances of getting interviews without getting into trouble.
I often see roles titled 'law graduates' on recruiting websites, are these roles only for those who have completed both a law degree and PLT? I also see a lot of legal assistant and paralegal roles that are intended for pursuing a long-time career, should I still apply for them?
Sorry if this comes across as a rant or as though as I am blaming others.

st0li,"The alternative risk is that a foreign LLB may get screened (I don’t have firm info on this either way). If you really think the Diploma point could be the issue holding your applications back I would personally experiment by contacting the recruiter / talent contact for the next couple roles you apply for and obtaining their guidance. Nothing to lose by doing so.
Mileage varies. I prefer to liaise with recruiters directly and get them to handle the application but I am 7+ PQE and if you’re applying for your first role you probably need to be more flexible about it. I’d also suggest working on aligning your answers to the job criteria as far as you can (obviously without lying). The goal of the application stage is to present yourself in the best way to get to interview stage, not to talk your way out of an interview by giving answers that you know don’t align. Put another way - why would you be applying for the role in the first place if you don’t align with key job criteria?
If you want to be a lawyer then roles in the legal sector will be most beneficial. Depending on the type of law you want to do there can be some benefit in working client side in commercial / procurement roles because it can show firms you have commercial acumen. I know a few people who have transitioned into legal roles from those positions. Still not super common though.
Depends on what you’re doing. To me a legal assistant is only really handling administrative work. If you are doing any tasks in the nature of legal research, drafting etc then I would go with intern.
You can complete PLT while you’re a graduate. All the top tier and mid tier firm grad programs assume that grads will finalise their PLT while working at the firm in their first year, and get admitted during that year. As for applying for legal assistant / paralegal roles - honestly, do what you need to do depending on how important it is to secure any kind of paid gig imminently.

Junior lawyers who expect to be spoon fed every detail, take no initiative, and want to be micro-managed are a supervisor's PITA.
If you are making no effort to find out the answers to questions yourself, and the information is readily available had you spent some time looking or asked colleague, that could be why one reason why you are getting some hostility.
A better way to approach these discussions can be to show that you have genuinely tried to find the answer yourself, and to (ideally) present solutions to the supervisor and ask which solution they would like you to follow. ""I looked at X, Y and Z, and it seems like there are 3 ways we can go about this task. I think the best way is option 1, and I checked with Jane who agrees, but before I go down that path, I wanted to check that you agreed or wanted me to go with another approach?""

It’s good that you’re working hard and presumably learning a lot. It will stand you in good stead for when you come off lockstep pay and can point to a history of good financial performance in seeking a pay uplift towards the maximum end of the band.

Few options for looking for a paralegal role. Monitor job websites like Seek or LinkedIn jobs. Monitor the job websites for firms in your city. You'll likely be targeting mid-tiers and boutiques early on in your degree so pay particular attention to these firms. See if your university's law society have a jobs board as they may sometimes post off-market jobs. If you know people in the law, leverage these connections. I also wouldn't be afraid of cold emailing some of the smaller firms in your city as well and shooting your shot.
If you are in a financial position to, your best bet may be seeking out an unpaid gig to at least start the ball rolling on getting legal experience. Volunteering with a community legal center or undertaking a university internship unit would be the way to go in this respect.

Don’t ‘think’ about it. Google ADHD symptoms and consider whether they apply to you (particularly the inattentive type). Go to your GP and ask for a mental health plan and mention the potential for your adhd if you think the symptoms may apply. Start taking control of your life and health.

Those are the years that you spend learning, where your charge out rate is still cheap enough for you to sit in on mediations and court hearings and take notes for the senior lawyer. That being said, the mid tiers I worked at when I was at that level had targets of about 5.5 billable hours per day to meet budget, so still a lot better than large firms. 
For grads, you may not have a budget, but your performance in your grad year may be determinative of whether the firm gives you an ongoing contract (if you're fixed term), or at least which practice group you settle in and whether anyone gives you work or trains you. There is definitely a baseline of competence and work ethic below which it's not worthwhile for seniors to train a person. It's in your interests to show that you are capable of exceeding this baseline.

Life_Manufacturer611,"Hello all,
Currently working as a FL Paralegal in a small-mid tier firm and have run into quite the predicament regarding a job offer.
Some background, I started at the current firm I am at as a legal admin in Jan 2024 and have worked my way up and was promoted to paralegal in Sept 2024. Since I have enjoyed my job and have been working well, I was learning the ropes of being a paralegal for the last part of 2024 and the start of 2025 in which bills were not my top priority but more so learning the job. Since in or around Feb 2025 I have hit and exceeded my billable target consistently and in fact bill more than some people who work full-time at my firm. In short and not to toot my own horn I am a top performer.
The owner of my firm is also very popular in a LOTE (language other than English) community in my city and I too speak this language. Recently I have completed and am about to get a NAATI certification as a translator and have been promised translating work by the current owner of the firm.
So here is the current situation: I attended an interview at another firm this week in which they were very impressed by me and claimed I was the top applicant and they were very much impressed by my knowledge, presentation and spoken ability. In other words I secured the job. My current TC (Total Compensation) is $65,000 plus super on a pro-rata rate of 3 days per week. The TC that I have been offered by the firm I interviewed at is $90,000 per annum + super + a monthly bonus which is 35% of however much $$$ I bill excess of my billable target, so if my target was 10,000 and I billed 13,000 my bonus would be in or around $1,050.
The dilemma I have now is, do I go to this firm and risk loosing the translating work from my current firm?
I would greatly appreciate any advice anyone has regarding this and if you have questions about anything I haven't covered please feel free to ask.
Thank you!",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1kpy6nc/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Interviews,

How important is the certification to you and can you see it opening more doors further down your career? Additionally, aside from the great money and bonus, what does the new firm offer you in terms of your professional development? Will there be similar growth opportunities like the translation services or will you be stuck in the grind?

The new firm is similar in size, picture it as simply a salary upgrade, same size firm, same responsibilities etc.
I have a hunch that my boss isn't the type of person to say ""oh you betrayed me by leaving my firm, I won't give you client's to translate for"" in fact I think he still will.
I plan to discuss with him on Monday to see if I can get a better offer from him or even the same. Shit i'd even take lower because I like where I work.

The general situation: - I am an American citizen - Graduated undergrad a few years ago with high marks, and have been working as a consultant - Personally, lived in Australia before and have some strong relationship ties
I have always wanted to be a lawyer, but frankly don’t think I can do it in America. Law school tuition and a JD program is $70k US/ year. I am confident with my undergrad marks I can get into Uni Melb or Monash or another top program which would be 1/2 the cost. Furthermore the hours of at big law here in the U.S. are often over 100 for most practices. I know I can’t work like that long term.
To be eligible to sit for the bar in the US (in case I need to come back) I would need to join the bar in Australia, and I know I would need work experience for this unlike in the U.S where eveyone joins the bar to practice.
Ergo, I have a few main questions.
Am I correct the hours tend to be shorter even in big law (mid or top tier)?
What do you reckon the chances are of being hired under a 485 graduate visa / and or being sponsored by a firm? I am happy to put in the work and network, but I guess I need to know if it’s possible
If anyone can just speak from their own experience or understanding that would be greatly appreciated.

Skylar_with_and_L,"I’m a recent law grad with no prior experience in construction law, and I just started working at a construction law firm. To be honest, I’m spiraling into serious self-doubt.
My boss handed me a contract for the sale of land along with an information memorandum and asked me to identify risks for a potential purchaser. I’ve been relying heavily on common sense and ChatGPT to make sense of the onerous clauses, but:
1.  The back of the contract includes a bunch of deposit plans, sewage diagrams, and site/floor plans—I can barely read them and don’t really know what I should be looking for.

2.  Is it expected for construction lawyers to be able to interpret architectural or civil engineering diagrams? I’ve seen similar plans in conveyancing, but this feels like a whole new level. Am I supposed to understand technical drawings like an engineer would? I asked my boss and he just said “go through the full contract properly,” but he doesn’t really have time to guide me.

3.  How much can we actually rely on tools like ChatGPT in this kind of legal work? I’m working remotely, so it’s hard to get help from colleagues.

don_homer,"If this is a commercial property purchase and the firm has no expertise in commercial property, it is incredibly incredibly risky for the firm to take on this work. If this is a residential property purchase then the risk is somewhat reduced, but not by a huge factor.
Don't rely on AI. The only thing it is doing is linking key words with other key words. It cannot produce any insightful legal analysis.
First, check your scope of work agreed with the client. Are you just reviewing the contract terms or are you actually reviewing the vendor disclosure materials attached to the contract? Some law firms exclude the latter. If the latter is not excluded, then are you doing an exceptions review or are you summarising the entire thing for the client? And are you excluding advice on planning and environmental issues? Or is that in scope as well?
Once you fully understand your scope, go to your college of law materials and look up the textbook sections that deal with buying and selling land. Read them. If you have a LexisNexis / Thomson Reuters etc subscription, track down a copy of their 'acting for purchaser' checklist and follow it. If you don't have such a subscription, search your state law society or LawCover for anything relating to conveyancing guidelines and checklists.

I hate to say it (because grades are hogwash), but if you’re not doing so well on the grades, the barrier to a grad role at a big firm will be a lot higher. You might be auto-culled before you get your reasons in the door.
If this boutique tax firm has a decent reputation, I wouldn’t have thought you’d have trouble transitioning over in a few years. Attrition is massive and the big firms will be looking to fill the gaps where they can.
You might come to love the boutique practice as well, and get to know counsel a bit better - I’ve heard the tax bar is very lucrative if that’s something you’d consider down the line.

They all teach the same thing, the only real difference is that you can leverage the Go8 reputation from UQ/QUT and the grad network of those plus Bond. Id you can get in UQ or QUT is probably the best play.
I would personally look into an LLB graduate entry program because they are typically cheaper than the JD.
Is the job market in QLD decent for new grads, especially outside big firms?
No.
Is full-time work + full-time JD realistic, or is part-time better?
Really depends on you.
If you're very good at self-directed study and time management you should be fine working full-time. If you require more interaction in your learning then you will likely want to opt for an arrangement that lets you attend face-to-face.
I would also note that it will likely be quite a significant shift from your IT background to law so that might add in some unexpected growing pains.
Does my tech/comms background actually help in law?
Only to the extent that it will give you a benefit in understanding some particular technical aspects of subject matter that you might be working on. It might also help you sell yourself to prospective employers but it won't be anything game changing.
And honestly — is it worth switching careers at 30?

Some lecturers are amazing, others very poor. Literally reading from a powerpoint, verbatim, no discussion or tangential interactions.
We do have some tough assignments, but others are incredibly simplistic and worth 20-30% of the total marks.

In terms of reputation the same applies here in Aus - it matters a fair deal. UWA would be the most reputable of the three, La Trobe second and Bond third. But a degree from UWA wouldn't mean as much if the goal is to work in Melbourne straight after graduating. Post-grad opportunities are very saturated and you'll find it especially difficult as an international.

Background-Ad1834,"As a junior lawyer or law clerk, the experience you will gain in a litigation practice will largely depend upon the size of the firm.
At a smaller firm you’re more likely to be hands on in terms of drafting, client contact ect. There is however the risk that you’ll be flooded with work or subjected to the ‘sink or swim’ approach.
At a larger firm, your role could very well be very narrow and limited to some of the more mundane aspects of litigation. In saying that, large firms attract large matters, whereas smaller firms may have a broader range of matters they take on.
But there’s more to consider than just exposure to work. Things like pay, culture and the management structure are equally important aspects.

Mammoth_Raspberry_71,"Hi everyone
About 8PQE, female, lives near Sydney CBD.
I want to start a new practice in NSW. I've only ever prosecuted (5 years), though I have private experience in estates, commercial litigation and some insolvency (3 years).
This is a long list of questions in no particular order. Feel free to cherry pick.
Can someone talk me through practical tips for engaging with clients? Interested in both summary and EAGP matters. Eg. Do you meet clients in person first? How and how often do you visit clients in gaol? How do you manage your own safety? Do you take money in trust? What if you suspect the money is proceeds of crime? When do you engage counsel? How do you deliver hard truths? What do you do if you think your client's case is poor or they're being dishonest?
At what stage in the EAGP process do you actually review the brief and how thorough are you? Are you checking LEPRA and chains of custody for every semi important item? If the brief is very large, how do you estimate fees in advance? Do you get a barrister to review?
Any tips on advertised location? Very open atm. Considering North Sydney CBD, the CBD itself or near a Court (eg. Burwood, Parramatta).
How reliably can I fall back on legal aid work if I'm not getting private matters?
Fee estimates. What is a normal rate for a sole practitioner? What are the usual flat fee estimates for a straightforward summary sentence, bail app, etc.? How do you structure your estimates?
What sort of crimes and clients: A. Make up the bulk of your practice? B. Are your favourite to work with and why? C. Are the most lucrative (sorry to be crass)
Should I advertise for civil/property work too?
What do you do when a trial falls away and you've cleared your calendar for it?
Any business development tips would be great.
What's a good billing year? How much should I aim to bill in year 1, 2 and 3 of practice? Please share your figures if game!
Any tips on managing kids as a sole practitioner? Assume my husband can only be around for evenings.
I've been spoilt with internal resources at the Crown and am nervous about leaving it all. A. Any recommended NSW resources/sources of truth for defence lawyers (aside from just word searching on Westlaw/Lexis)? Interested in commentary on offence elements, databases of sentencing comparative cases, guidance on LEPRA, alternate charges to inform plea negotiations, etc. B. Where can I find good criminal templates and starting points for drafting documents? E.g. standard explanations to clients (EAGP process, driving offences, sentencing factors), appeal/sentencing submissions, etc. C. Should I pay for Westlaw/Lexis?
Open to all tips and personal experiences.

Honestly_Mine,"I don’t practise in crime, but I am a sole practitioner and mother & my husband is only home in the evenings :). So to that end:
1) if you have your own trust account you need to get it audited each year. I don’t use mine a lot as try to avoid estates & it still costs $1500+pa. If you don’t use a trust acc then just be right onto billing I think - like bill the first appt or work out how many hours you’re happy to carry before billing.
2) seems to me there’s heaps of crime work around so think you’d be able to carry just that 🤷🏻‍♀️
3) balancing kids - depends on their ages. I assume you have some sort of care if you can do court work. I don’t so just work while kids sleep or when husband gets home, and housework is a bit lower down than I’d like haha.
4) resources - just read judgments, they tell you everything. I just use Austlii & its noteup feature and love it. If you get Leap then LawY could help with research.
5) business development - if you haven’t already you’ll need to do your practice management course before going out on your own and it has heaps of business development stuff in it. You can also get involved with people running business development. The Happy Family Lawyer is an example.

Worked as a foot in the term for me, and may do for you as well. However your age may be a bigger barrier for a lot of firms. If you continue on part-time you'll likely be in your 40s by the time you grad. Not unheard of, but even more of a barrier of entry still.
Consider as well the hours you are going to be putting in if you pursue this path. What kind of time and energy are you going to have to spend with your children if you are working 70-80 hour weeks? Working weekends and late nights? How is this going to impact your partner?
TLDR: ask yourself if it is worth it to spend years studying, with the intensity required needed to get the grades that the big firms will even consider worthwhile, racking up more debt in the process, depart your very high paying and relatively low stress job, hope that you make it through as one of the thousands of applicants hungry for grad spots with these big firms, just to work considerably longer hours for 5-6 years, missing out on many moments with your family, for the reward of earning what you already earn? My two cents but I think you should kick your feet up, enjoy your sweet pay checks and normal working hours and forget about the need for $ advancement at all. Your on a good wicket, make the most of it - study law if you love it and and find somewhere quiet to transition out to.

thiccinvestments,"I know this is a very general question and im sure one asked ever since law began being practiced. Ill provide some brief info so you know my background:
- First year law student
- asking in regards to theory/how to approach a project, not a real legal issue
- asking in regards to the legal argument itself, not a moral question.
What im struggling with is this: how do you approach arguing in favour for a (fictional) client, when you believe the rules are not in favour of their cause? Again, I'm not referring to a moral issue about how do you represent a client you believe has done something wrong, but rather the technical aspect. I have a fictional client and issue. All the statutory interpretation skills ive employed in evaluating the issue itself tell me the client likely wont get what they want. But then I have a part 2, which is designed for me to be assessed on oral persuasion. Most oral skills here seem easy enough to employ, presentation, the way you talk, structuring your argument, yadda-yadda.
But what Im struggling with is, how do I argue a legal construction which preferences the client when all my honest interpretations of the relevant (fictional) laws tell me otherwise? I've got like 1 possible interpretation that I think 'may' go the client's way but other than that, im just stuck. How do you argue for the rule or provision to go the way you want it, when all your genuine interpretations point the other way? This is not a situation where I can talk about the client's history and trying to convince a judge to go easy on sentencing either. So im feeling quite stuck how to approach this concept in general.

As for not believing the case you are advancing, that's something we all face. Use that doubt to refine your arguments. Then when you stand up, it'll come naturally.

Does the assignment dictate that your client has to be successful?
If it does, I would suggest re-considering your interpretation. If it does not, best approach would be:
Evaluation and explain the issue that has arisen from the facts of the matter;
Review the relevant legislation;
Apply that legislation to the relevant facts;
Explain your argument as to why the client will/won't be successful

So yeah, the first part we do what you said. But then I have to do an oral presentation arguing in favour of the client. It feels like an odd ask to me too.
Like for example, there's always a couple of ways you could feasibly interpret a provision, so I could, for example argue whichever intepretation favours the client, even if I don't think its the most accurate. But that just feels inept and wrong, to argue intepretations that you do not think are the most realistic and accurate interpretations.

Express_Influence_96,"You’re not alone, many people in healthcare consider moving into law, especially if they’re looking for a change in pace or intellectual challenge.
A few things to keep in mind:
LLB (Graduate Entry) vs JD Both lead to legal admission in Australia. The JD is the postgraduate pathway, but the graduate-entry LLB is cheaper and often assessed with more flexibility. The content is virtually identical. If you’re cost-conscious, the LLB is worth serious consideration.
Study Load and Difficulty Law involves an intense reading and writing workload. It’s not rote learning—it’s about reasoning, case analysis, and argument structure. The volume of material can be overwhelming, especially during exams and assessments.
Reality of Legal Work Law is not glamorous. You will spend around 90% of your time reading, drafting, and editing dense documents. It is mentally demanding and highly detail-oriented. If you’re picturing courtroom drama or advocacy, that’s the exception, especially in junior roles.
Work Conditions and Salary Graduate salaries generally sit between $65,000 and $90,000 depending on the role and sector. Unlike nursing, there is no overtime pay. Long hours are common, especially in private practice. It can be difficult to switch off, and the profession is known for being high-stress with high burnout rates.
Peer Environment and Culture Law school can feel competitive, but you’ll find collaborative students too, especially if you seek out supportive networks. The culture varies by institution and firm.
Joining the Bar This means becoming a barrister, an independent courtroom advocate who takes briefs from solicitors. It requires additional exams and training post-degree. Most law graduates become solicitors, not barristers.
If you’re drawn to critical thinking, systems, and policy work, law might suit you. Just be clear-eyed about the reality: it’s challenging, intellectually rewarding for some, but rarely glamorous, and certainly not an easy career change.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1li2h5w/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Interviews,
howzyaday,"yes!! and they usually go into law that handles with healthcare and stuff and i think that could be a possibility for me too.
with the LLB and JD pathways, the uni i am looking at i think only provides the JD pathway. do they have the same career options or opportunities?
did you do law? how many units if you remember did you do per semester? i am a little concerned about the study load since i would love to keep a part time job and maybe even put my nursing degree to use part time while i study.
is it anything like suits? haha. i know that you are not even likely to step in a courtroom even as a lawyer but other than that what else is day to day like? or is it just like that daily?
that is not too far off of nursing, but it is kind of discouraging. so much work and overwhelm for much pay, but i would rather have a mentally straining job than a physical one. plus in a law firm or office i dont imagine having to smell poop daily.
what about work culture? and what should i expect? do you have a lot of people interaction in the office? and i’ve seen a lot of people saying there are unrealistic and big pressure when it comes to targets.
okay thank you! i will look into that.
i think i am still interested but will have more of a think. i also have a background in an accounting cert, so i am not too unfamiliar with tedious, detail-oriented and system based work.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1li2h5w/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Firm Culture,
howzyaday,"Hey friend, I went from healthcare to law. Almost done with the JD now. We do trimesters so I’ve done 2 units per tri, so 6 units a year.
JD and LLB have the same career prospects. LLB has a younger cohort. JD will have people older with varied professional experiences.
I was on rotating day and night shifts while balancing classes and exams. I wouldn’t say it’s healthy, but where there’s a will, there’s a way. Things got easier when I landed a full time role in the law firms. After that it’s all about having a routine and being consistent.
No it’s not like suits haha. The amount of courtroom experience depends on the area of law. For example, I worked in personal injury and went to court every couple of rooms. In transactional law now, which is more like what they talk about on suits. Zero court room.
Work culture is dependent on the people, the not firm imo. Just depends who you get along with tbh. My lawyers work a lot beyond full time hours and unfortunately that’s to be expected in many practice areas.
I found having a stem background lends itself quite well to law because of the analytical reasoning that’s required. If you’re wanting to go into personal injury law, getting good at things like IMISTAMBO are really helpful.

It's a tough practice area for a range of reasons but can be a good starting point if you want to be a litigator. You'll likely get broader experience than many of your colleagues in other large firms of running files, being on your feet in court and dealing directly with clients; but the legal issues are certainly narrower than other areas of litigation, especially as you get more senior.
Having a team you like is also a big consideration though, as a toxic team / partner is crushing.

I’m currently in the process of pursuing my LLB in India and am looking at potential career paths after completing my degree. I’m particularly interested in moving to Australia for an LLM, but I’m also considering the possibility of pursuing an MBA or Msc Finance, depending on how things unfold.
My primary question is about the prospects of entering corporate law or business-focused roles in Australia(or even other countries) after completing an LLM abroad. Specifically, I’d like to know:
Is an LLM from Australia (or abroad) a strong pathway to transitioning into corporate law or business-related legal roles?
I’m aware that many firms in Australia value international exposure, but how much weight does the LLM carry compared to experience or other qualifications?
Would an MBA or Msc Finance make sense if I want to break into the corporate side of business or law?
Would that combination of qualifications make me more competitive for roles like in-house counsel, corporate law, or even something like legal consulting?
Are there any specific things I should be mindful of as an international graduate from India—whether in terms of visa requirements, networking, or expectations from employers in Australia?

A lot of this depends entirely on your firm and team, but there are some regularities across firms on the transactional side.
Targets are much higher - 6.5 would be the minimum, 7 or 7.5 is more probable)
flexibility is likely to be more limited, particularly around deal closings.

You might liaise with your colleagues in an international office or a client in another country, or get a foreign execution opinion letter. It’s not particularly exciting. It can actually fucking suck if you have to do a lot of calls with NY or London (time zones are not your friend).

International secondments are rare and hotly contested. International travel is mostly done by partners.

(deleted),"Understood. I'm not across the process for English/Welsh qualified lawyers becoming qualified in Aus but you'd probably have to do some kind of bridging course (probably the GDLP) to be admitted as a practitioner here. I suspect there's plenty of information online about it.
In terms of finding out whether your experience is transferable - I've heard moving from offshore to an onshore common law jurisdiction can be more challenging, given how niche Cayman/BVI law is and the kinds of clients you service. I interviewed with two Cayman firms last year (to test the waters) and while they liked my general DR experience, they ended up going with English lawyers who had more targeted insolvency-related experience (and who had already done some offshore work). But, if I were you (particularly at your PQE level), I'd make a list of all the top tier firms in Sydney, key partners/Special Counsels practising in insolvency and make direct contact over email - asking whether they would consider someone with your background and expressing your interest in a move to Sydney. I've had a couple of matters where we dealt (very tangentially) with Cayman entities from a discovery perspective, but we don't see it a lot.
My last point - as you could probably tell from the tone of my comment - is that Australia (similar to the UK) is fucked when it comes to cost of living/housing relative to income. I don't think people who aren't experiencing it quite fully appreciate how dire it is. A lot of us, at least in my own DR team, are feeling deflated with future prospects and there's a general malaise that makes life here a bit depressing. It's an issue that's constantly talked about and in the media daily. Most of us are trying to figure out ways to get ahead of it, including moving internationally. I've already had 3 colleagues move to London last year.
To give you a real-world example, my AUD$185k senior associate salary gets reduced to about AUD90k p/a (USD58k p/a!) after superannuation, student debt and taxes are knocked off(~AUD$8,500 p/m). Take off $3k in rent, utilities, and ordinary expenses, which are no longer ordinary with even a standard grocery shop hitting the pocket hard. In a good month, you could put away $2k. In a bad month (medical appointments, other misc bills, or trying to treat yourself with dinners out) you might not save a cent. When even an entry-level, poorly built, 2 bedroom apartment costs AUD$700k+ you're left feeling very stuck. This is anecdotal, experiences differ, and you might have a friendship group or find colleagues who have managed to avoid this scenario. I appreciate not everyone's in this situation, but when you see yourself and others struggling, it doesn't make for a great experience more generally. In the last few months, I've literally overheard 3 Brits talking in public about their expenses/costs of things here. All of this to say that you should really run the numbers yourself before you decide to make the move and consider the cultural shift from an expat island (where people are on a good wicket and probably have a more positive financial outlook) to a country where even 'highly' paid professionals aren't having the best time.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1li2h5w/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Interviews,

Own-Airline5639,"I’m currently working as a clerk 3 days a week in a national mid tier firm, and have been there for just over 4 months. I’m working in the corporate team, which is a practice area I think I want to pursue a career in. As far as I can tell, there would likely be a grad position offered to me at the firm when I graduate in ~12 months time.
The two partners that interviewed me made a point of saying they value loyalty in my interview - and I think there was an unspoken expectation that I’d stay on as a graduate after my time as a clerk. This firm doesn’t do any kind of rotation for grads so I’d be staying in the corporate team indefinitely.
What I am trying to figure out is if I should be applying for seasonal clerkships to experience life at other firms/a top tier. My GPA is nothing special but I’m a hard worker and a people person so I think I’d be able to interview well.
I had originally planned to just stay put where I am, because my experience so far is that it’s a great firm with great people and I’m already in a practice area I like. But a lot of uni friends have been encouraging me to apply for seasonal clerkships just to “see what’s out there”.
My concern is that if I do a summer clerkship, but end up deciding that I want to stay put (or I don’t get any offers!), I will have shot myself in the foot in terms of my current firm and potentially burnt some bridges.

InevitableRole9011,"I’m 15 years old and currently considering law, though I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed and uncertain about which direction to take. I have a lot of questions, they might seem very scattered and excessive (sorry about that), but I’m genuinely trying to figure things out and would really appreciate any honest insight (I definitely don’t expect all of them to be answered).
Do you think law is a smart path to pursue in today’s world? Was it a good decision for you personally? If not, I’d genuinely appreciate your honesty, even if your experience was negative.
If you don’t mind me asking, what kind of salary range is typical in law? I know it can vary depending on the field and location, but could you give a general idea (e.g., $100–150k, $200–250k, etc.)? How many hours do you usually work, and do you feel you live comfortably?
For context, I tend to get good grades (mostly in the 80–90 range), and English is one of my strongest subjects. I really enjoy reading and writing, and I’m also interested in politics and history, which are probably my strengths. On the flip side, I really struggle with math. I know that enjoying reading or doing well in English doesn’t automatically mean law is the right fit, so I’m trying to be realistic. Do you need a very high ATAR for law school? Does getting a high ATAR influence your future career in law after law school?
One of my concerns is that I’m pretty shy and socially inept. I can handle public speaking when necessary, but it’s not something I feel confident in. Do you need to be a strong public speaker to succeed in law? Do you have to be very extroverted? How much of your job involves interacting with the public or clients, and is that something you find draining or frustrating?
What does a typical day actually look like for you? What kind of work do you do day-to-day?
I’m also curious about what fields of law are considered the best to pursue, in terms of income, comfort, and overall satisfaction. I’m semi-interested in criminal law, but I’m not necessarily fixed on it yet. What fields do you think are the best/most interesting or worth looking into?
Finally, what was your experience like in law school? Did you feel burnt out? Were the exams and workload overwhelming? Do you feel burnt out often?
Most importantly, do you actually enjoy your job? Would you recommend it?

Express_Influence_96,"Hi there,
First off, I want to say how impressive it is that you’re already asking such thoughtful and well-structured questions at 15. That curiosity and honesty will serve you incredibly well no matter what you end up pursuing.
Is law a smart path in today’s world?
Law is still a respected and versatile degree. It can lead to practising as a solicitor or barrister, but also opens doors in policy, consulting, government, business, and even tech and media. That said, the job market is competitive, and a law degree doesn’t guarantee financial success. What it does offer is intellectual challenge and the ability to work on meaningful issues, if that appeals to you, it’s worth exploring.
Was it a good decision personally?
For many, law brings satisfaction because it teaches structured thinking, strong communication, and how to defend a position. Others find it rigid, stressful, or at odds with their personal values. Personally, I found it worthwhile, but not without challenges. I’d advise shadowing someone in the field or speaking to a few law grads to get a more balanced view.
Salary ranges?
Salary varies widely: • Graduates: $65k–$95k depending on firm and city • 3–5 years PQE (post-qualified experience): $85k–$150k • Senior Lawyers: $150k–$300k+ Top-tier corporate firms and in-house legal counsel roles can exceed $300k, but they often come with long hours. Government and not-for-profit roles pay less but offer more work-life balance.
Work hours and lifestyle?
Big law firms: Expect 50–70+ hours per week. Government/legal aid/community law: Usually 38–45 hours with more predictability. Whether that’s comfortable depends on your lifestyle expectations. Some lawyers thrive in high-pressure settings, others burn out quickly.
ATAR and law school entry?
Yes, most top Australian universities require a high ATAR (usually 95+). However, alternative pathways exist, through bridging programs, transferring from another degree, or mature-age entry. Once you’re in the workforce, your ATAR becomes irrelevant. Your grades at uni, work ethic, and people skills matter more.
Do you need to be good at public speaking?
You don’t have to be extroverted or a natural speaker. Many brilliant lawyers are introverts. What matters is clear communication, written and spoken. Public speaking is a skill you can learn (and most law schools give you plenty of chances to practise).
What does a typical day look like?
That depends on your area of practice. In general: • Corporate lawyer: Reading contracts, drafting documents, meetings with clients, negotiating deals. • Criminal lawyer: Court appearances, preparing briefs, meeting clients, legal research. • Family lawyer: Advising clients, court filings, mediation work. Much of it involves reading, writing, and advising—not always as glamorous as TV portrays.
Fields of law to consider? • Commercial law – high income, high pressure • Family/criminal law – emotionally intense, but very meaningful • Employment law – growing area, especially post-COVID • Human rights/law reform – very rewarding, but limited jobs and lower pay • In-house counsel – balance of business/legal, often better work-life balance
Law school experience?
Law school is tough, expect a lot of reading, writing, and analysing. Exams can be stressful. Group assignments can be challenging. Many students feel imposter syndrome or burnout. But with good habits and support, it’s manageable.
Do I enjoy it? Would I recommend it?
Yes and no. I enjoy helping people, making arguments, and solving problems. But I wouldn’t recommend law just because it “sounds good” or “pays well.” I’d recommend it if: • You’re curious about how the world works • You like logic and problem-solving • You care about reasoned argument • You’re ready for consistent hard work
Final thoughts: You don’t have to decide everything now. Explore legal podcasts like The Lawyers Weekly, talk to law students (go to open days), or even read free legal cases online. Follow your interests whether in justice, storytelling, or society and the right path will emerge.

heg_8710,"Final year student weighing up a few potential PLT options for once I graduate at the end of the year. Currently working for a large government department that has been great and I would potentially like to stay at for the next few years if possible. I didn’t do any clerkships and my WAM isn’t great, but I have lots of legal experience and a good reputation where I am working, so I think there’s a good chance that they will want to keep me on.
Option 1 is doing a traineeship where I am. Pros of this are not paying for PLT, getting a variety of experience in different areas of the department and likely receiving a solicitor role after finishing. The big con is that it’s 12 months so wouldn’t be admitted until March 2027, which is a much longer time without receiving a lawyer salary.
Option 2 is transitioning to a full time role in whatever area of my department has a legal assistant position open at the end of the year and then smashing out PLT as fast as possible. I would be able to do my placement days at work (paid), but I’m not sure of the likelihood of getting a solicitor role there once admitted as these mostly go to the trainees. Pros are that I’d be admitted and applying for lawyer jobs from mid-2026 and earning a lawyer salary much earlier. I also wouldn’t feel locked into where I’m working if I stop liking it.
Are there any major pros or cons that I’m missing here? The traineeship makes sense on paper but I really don’t want to be in limbo for another year waiting to be admitted.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1li2h5w/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Applications,

Nice_Astronomer3102,"Hi guys need some advice.
I’m currently doing my undergrad in finance and accounting at curtin university in Perth, with a gpa of 6.6 on a 7 point scale. I was originally intending on going into corporate finance/investment banking but have realised I have the marks to go on and do a JD at uwa. Corp finance is so competitive, and not being from a go8 school is definitely limiting my options with networking and such as we just don’t have the club infrastructure. I’m still intending on going for corp finance internships, but I’ve secured a vacationer in external audit at one of the big 4 accounting firms.
Law seems very interesting and enticing to me, and I would love to go into corporate law. I know I can get competitive marks to break in. Is anyone in perth currently working in big law able to give me some insight into the job market and just provide general information about breaking in?
Much thanks",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1li2h5w/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Practice Areas,
Express_Influence_96,"Hi there,
Just a quick word of advice from someone further down the path, don’t pursue a JD just because you think it might lead to more money or prestige. Law can be intellectually rewarding and occasionally lucrative, but the reality is that most of your time especially in corporate law, will be spent drafting, reviewing, and redrafting documents. That’s the job. If you don’t enjoy reading dense material, writing with precision, and spending long hours at your desk, it may not be the right fit.
A JD is also a significant time and financial investment. If you’re already excelling in finance and have secured a Big 4 vacationer role, you’re well on the way to a successful career that can offer equally strong remuneration and exit opportunities. Corporate finance, consulting, or even internal strategy roles in large companies can be just as (if not more) financially rewarding long-term.
Pursue law only if you’re genuinely interested in legal reasoning, critical analysis, and the kind of work lawyers actually do not just courtroom drama or prestige. Happy to answer more questions if you’re on the fence.
All the best.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1li2h5w/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Interviews,

Got the highest grade in the entire cohort in Crim Law A, mum was diagnosed with terminal cancer shortly thereafter. As the eldest of 4 siblings with no extended family I was so mentally and emotionally burdened by the ordeal that I resorted to a ""Ps get degrees"" mentality. Evidently, prospective employers don't give a fuck what I had to go through -- go figure. I dread the inevitable request for an academic transcript.

Regardless, my real goal is to become a barrister and I'm looking into sitting the exam Feb 2026. My true calling has always been advocacy, which was confirmed for me when I formulated and argued submissions on a point of evidence against senior counsel in a District Court motion and won (best part about boutique is they'll let you have a go at stuff like that). I've started making readership applications to chambers with reader's rooms, and a few barristers I've previously worked with (Wentworth, Banco) have agreed to read with me. Problem is -- my uni marks are shit, I've never worked top or even midtier and I've never been a tipstaff/judge's associate. The more I look at the reader profiles on various chambers' websites, the more I lose hope I'll ever score a position in a reader's room. All that considered -- am I just completely fucked? Am I destined for a life of being rotated through boutique/medium sized firms with mediocre work? Am I out of my depth thinking I can secure a reader position in a chambers with even a modicum of reputability, despite having secured tutors on some of the best floors in the game?

pattytheperuser,"I want to be realistic with you because in hindsight I regret listening to the ""marks aren't the be all and end all"" people. Law differs from other professions, there is significant emphasis on academic pedigree the higher you go up in tier. To make a blanket statement that your uni grades don't matter beyond 1-2PQE is categorically false.
Here is my honest assessment of the probability of landing a role at the different levels of firms, based on lived experience.
Grad level with poor or below average marks, which I would define as below a credit average (0PQE, including with experience in legal support/paralegal roles):
- Toptier: no hope
- Midtier: highly improbable, unless you have connections
- Boutique: probable, but you will still get quite a few applications rejected, it all depends on the firm's/principal's values (i.e. some principals don't give a shit about marks, some are ex top tier and definitely do, there's no hard and fast rule with boutiques). You will likely resort to applying for roles in any area of law and accepting the first one you can land.
2PQE with poor or below average marks and decent experience in 1 area of practice:
- Toptier: keep dreaming
- Midtier: possible, but still challenging, and only in the area of practice you have gained experience in (unlikely you'll be able to make a lateral move eg move from insurance litigation to commercial litigation, which is probably the type of move you'll be wanting to make at 2PQE level, unless you really loved the area of law you happened to fall into in the boutique role)
- Boutique: likely, a little more challenging to make a lateral move but still possible particularly if you've gained transferrable skills (ie you worked in insurance litigation now want to move to commercial litigation, you have transferrable skills as an experienced litigator)
3-5PQE with poor or below average marks and significant experience in 1 or 2 areas of practice
- Toptier: highly unlikely unless something about your experience makes you stand out, even then your transcript will betray you (the competition at this level is simply too high)
- Midtier: probable, a little less challenging, but only in the area of practice you have gained experience in (will still face rejection trying to make a lateral move, perhaps moreso at this level because you're in too deep in the area you practice ie you're officially ""pigeonholed"")
- Boutique: highly likely, more lenience to make a lateral move especially with transferrable skills
I hope the above helps you. My advice is, don't fuck around with your uni marks. Do the absolute best you can. Yes, you will definitely still get a job as a lawyer regardless, but it will likely be at lower quality firms with lower quality work until you're much further down the line and have tangibly proven yourself, and even then your chances of getting toptier will always be slim.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1l6qqhm/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Applications,

The fact a 2.5 hour exam constitutes 60% of your grade is absolutely insane. Each semester I’ll do great on the mid term assignments, then bomb the exam. I’ve tried different study methods, different note structures, different answer methods all to no avail.
With the exception of admin law (where I was able to pre-write practically every answer), every single exam has ended before I’ve been able to finish. This just happened again for my tax law exam.

Everything else that’s pretty straight forward is a given - just state that it’s uncontentious as X and that contentious elements/area pertain to Y. Then you try to analogise or distinguish it from case law. There will never really be “39 contentious areas of law”, in every hypothetical question there are really maybe 2-3. Every single line in every single question tends to point toward a certain analogy in a case. You need to try address the ones that are actually contentious in detail. Then just restate the ones that aren’t contentious at all.  Disagree with the comment that doesn’t replicate anything. It replicates the ability to distinguish between things that are straightforward and things that require careful consideration and advice and how you allocate words and time towards each fact.

Hello, I hope you’re well. 
Seeking advice please on which path to pursue given my current goals. 
I am currently in my fifth year of studying a Bachelor of Criminology/Laws (Australia). My WAM is around 70 and I am on an Academic Excellence Scholarship. I also live with a number of medical conditions and currently I am only able to study part-time. I have 13 units left of my Bachelor of Criminology/Laws or 2 units left of my Bachelor of Criminology. 
My current goal is to work as a Policy Officer, Policy Analyst, Project Officer or in a research role within Social Justice and Community Development areas. Unfortunately, law units in particular severely flare up my medical conditions and my overall goal is to start working part-time/full-time soon. I am also very interested in studying a Master of Public and Social Policy (Macquarie University). 
Moreover, I would like to add that I deem it very unlikely that I would maintain a WAM around 70 if I were to complete the rest of my Law degree. I foresee being able to realistically only achieve passes or credits. As a result, I may also lose my Academic Excellence Scholarship. 
I am currently deciding on my next steps and choosing between pursuing these potential paths:
Completing my Bachelor of Criminology/Laws. 
Completing my Bachelor of Criminology/Laws + Master of Public and Social Policy (Macquarie University). 
Alternative Exist - Completing my Bachelor of Criminology + Master of Public and Social Policy (Macquarie University).

The amount of time a lawyer spends on lockstep varies firm by firm. Again, as a general rule, I wouldn't expect a lawyer to be eligible for a bonus until their 4th remuneration review. Typically there would be a lockstep remuneration increase at admission (or conclusion of graduate program), at 1PQE, then at 2PQE (so 3 lockstep increases). From 3PQE onwards (i.e. the 4th rem review) is where bonus eligibility would typically kick in.
Bonuses would typically be calculated based on a percentage of your base salary, and capped at a maximum percentage or $ figure. Eligibility usually requires more than 100% of utilisation target and more than 100% of annual budget. Some firms will also link overall practice group or firm performance to bonus eligibility.

I'm in a grad role at a larger firm. Really not liking it, and the culture of working 10-12 hour days is not what I'm looking for. Maybe it's the area I'm in or the clientele (larger companies). I'm very thankful I have this role but it's soul sucking and it's made me rather depressed since I started in November last year. Some health issues I've had are also exacerbated, and the company doesn't really likepeoplee working from home. I also don't want to be partner, honestly I just want to be a good or great lawyer, who makes enough money to live, and has some worklife balance. I don't like commercial transactions, workers comp, and don't really enjoy wills + estates.
So I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on maybe practice areas or where I should look for positions? Switch to state govt or the APS? Somehow get a HR position? Does it get any better (working in private practice), what hours should I expect?

WFH is a bit variable. Pay is not terrible at lower levels but is pretty quickly outstripped by the private sector (or at least larger firms) after 5-6 years.
The APS (and perhaps state government, I just dont know much about that) practices more limited areas of law than the private sector, but its still pretty broad. Admin law, admin litigation, commercial and policy are generally the biggest areas, although there are WHS, employment and various other areas.
That said, the public service also take their own grads so hiring someone who is only 6 months in might be difficult.

Xsh_1569,"I’m a current law student at Monash, and I’m really stuck between pushing through my degree or walking away from it entirely. I’d really appreciate hearing how some of you figured out whether law was truly for you, or if you ever made the call to leave.
I’m doing a double degree in Law and International Relations. I absolutely thrive in IR — I get HDs, love the content, and genuinely look forward to the assignments. Law, on the other hand, feels like it’s slowly draining me. I’ve been having serious mental health issues around it: I need sleeping medication just to sit exams, I cry constantly during assessment periods, and the stress is so intense I can physically feel it in my chest. I also keep getting sick during exam week (like rn) because I’m so stressed and panicked that it wears me down.
What makes it harder is knowing some of that is on me. I don’t go to class enough, I procrastinate when things get overwhelming, and I don’t revise consistently — so of course I’m struggling. I transferred into Monash from a non-Go8 uni where my marks were a bit higher and the stress and issues were still there but not to this extent. I haven’t really enjoyed Monash so far (I’ve only been here half a year), and I know law is meant to be tough and burnout is common — but this feels like more than that.
I keep asking myself: am I just not putting in the effort? Would I be okay if I did the work like a “normal” student? Or am I genuinely just not cut out for law?
There’s also the image side of things. My family (especially my mum) has always been so proud to tell people I’m studying law. She says, “my daughter’s going to be a lawyer,” and I worry I’ll look like a quitter or a failure if I leave. I used to dream of becoming a barrister, maybe even a KC, but truth be told like a lot of law students I just wanted to make a decent am limit of money and sound impressive.
Right now, I work as a PA/EA to a very senior figure in multicultural public service and international affairs, and I love that kind of work. It’s made me seriously wonder whether I’m better suited to a career in diplomacy or the public service. But part of me still clings to the law path because I’m scared I’ll always wonder if I had the potential but gave up too soon. I honestly feel like I’ve always been miserable in this degree, and I don’t want to spend five years forcing myself through something I’ll never use.
So, how did you know law was (or wasn’t) for you? Was it something you grew to love? Was it tolerable pain with a worthwhile payoff? Did things change once you hit PLT or actual legal work? I’d love to hear your reflections - especially if you’ve been through the “stay or leave” dilemma.",https://old.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/1l6qqhm/weekly_students_careers_clerkships_thread/,Interviews,
