That said, the whole process for all the firms can be pretty arbitrary and can be incredibly non-sensical and unfair at times (as I keep reminding my friend who is going through the process this year who reminded me about Whirlpool after all this time). While there might be general rules of thumb, there are always going to be exceptions to the rule, so you just have to try not to drive yourself too crazy reading into it all too much and just know none of it is a genuine reflection on your self-worth or whether you will succeed in commercial law. :)",2025

Take this with a grain of salt as it's just my two cents but it's common for people to RSVP “yes” to multiple events and attend portions of each. In the meantime, it’s a good idea to reach out to the organisers and ask whether recordings will be available for any parts you might miss due to other information sessions scheduled that evening. You don’t need to mention which firms, as that’s honestly none of their business, but do clarify that the conflict is due to overlapping information nights, so they don’t mistakenly assume it’s a work/uni-related absence.",2025

Things like being responsive over email, showing reasonable availability (we don’t expect you to clear your schedules by any means but it doesn’t leave a great impression when candidates say their only availability in the next three weeks is 31 July 2025 5:55pm to 6:10pm), and being present and engaged during interactions does make a difference. While these informal touchpoints typically aren’t deal-breakers on their own, they do form part of the broader impression we provide back to the recruitment team. We’re generally asked to report back on things like attitude, preparedness, and overall enthusiasm. Turning up late to a one-on-one catchup, asking silly questions that could have been Googled beforehand at an information evening, or drinking too much at a networking event and calling a partner a corporate square (just why?!) is going to leave a negative impression, especially when compared to candidates who are making the effort. That said, life happens, and extenuating circumstances are absolutely understood. For example, I knew someone who had to miss a few sessions after getting their wisdom teeth removed – HR across multiple firms made it abundantly clear they didn’t want them showing up fresh out of surgery. Firms also know that you’ll have competing events – it’s about the overall effort and attitude. So if something comes up, don’t stress, just make sure to communicate clearly and proactively. The main thing is that under no circumstances should you fail to follow up after committing to attend or ghost them hoping it'll go unnoticed. It not only comes across as disrespectful to those who’ve set aside time for you, it gives the impression that you’re unreliable or do not follow through on your word (which is at the end of the day, all we've really got).",2025

I’m definitely not an expert in recruitment but was lucky enough to progress despite weaker grades. It probably depends on how you portrayed your t6 experience – did you take on “substantive” responsibilities in a “substantive” team (used very loosely). E.g., perhaps a paralegal role in the DR team may have given you more exposure to drafting/research than an intern role in one of the technology teams – not saying you don’t learn much in these teams, I’m sure you did and you will, but you’d likely do more research or drafting in the DR team (again, comes down to how you portray your experience). I’ve also been told other factors may include your ECs (did you have leadership positions or do comps) and whether you demonstrated a genuine interest in the application, sometimes saying “I’m really interested in X” isn’t enough, you’d probably have to mention an ongoing case the firm’s taking, who the partner taking the lead is and why that case is interesting to you. - Just my two cents, probably doesn’t mean much but hope it helps you get a peace of mind. I also don’t think the “oh that firm only hires a certain type” is a good mentality to have. I’m sure most don’t.",2025

That said, these are absolutely not hard cut-offs, just rough guidelines. The perception that being at a Go8 university gives you an edge is outdated (as someone who went to one, this isn’t a cope). Firms are increasingly aware that university choice is often shaped by access and privilege at the high school level, and they don't moderate marks based on your university. A 75 is a 75, regardless of where you studied. For those who don’t believe me, if you stalk previous recent clerk cohorts at the big firms on LinkedIn, you’ll see a really sizeable portion did not study at a Go8. In terms of work experience, firms generally just want to see that you’ve had some – it doesn’t need to be with a T6 firm or even a legal role. They’re aware that highly sought-after paralegal experience can sometimes come down to nepotism or connections, and they don’t necessarily see it as a marker of pure merit (that is not to say you haven’t worked hard, it’s just something to keep in mind – on LinkedIn, you can see a lot of summer clerks have only worked in hospitality/retail before commencing). In fact, if you already have a T6 paralegal role or are perceived as highly likely to go to the best firms, some firms might choose not to invest time interviewing you (as for partners, they’re forgoing $1,000ph), as they’re trying to protect their yield and conversion rates. Furthermore, you also don’t need to have elite-level extracurriculars like Jessup mooting or Law Journal. For example, I know someone who received multiple top-tier offers whose application centred around their passion as a pole dancing instructor. Firms just want to see some engagement outside of your studies. Once you've met the basic thresholds – a reasonable WAM, some work experience, and some form of extracurricular involvement – one of the biggest differentiators becomes the quality of your written application. Crafting strong applications are an art in themselves and the writing style is quite specific and can take time to master, so please do not beat yourself up, it’s not a reflection on you or your capabilities or potential. It’s also true that each firm tends to look for a certain type of candidate – not just in terms of qualifications, but personality and “fit”. The best analogy I can offer is that it’s a bit like fraternity or sorority rush – while the process may seem uniform on the surface, each firm has its own distinct culture and tends to gravitate toward a specific “vibe” in candidates eg. one firm I'm thinking of tends to take nerds who are the type to genuinely enjoy talking about constitutional law at lunch, another firm I'm thinking of has a big work hard party hard culture and is quite jock-y in their intake etc.",2025

My friend who clerked at KWM last year went to MQ with a WAM of 74. While she had extensive legal experience at a Mid-tier firm and extra-curricular, she actually received offers from all of the T06 except Allens. I'm not too sure what recruiters are genuinely looking for, but thinking a firm only accepts a TO8 University (UTS isn't that far behind), is a pretty outdated view, I'm pretty sure Allens in the only firm that cares about that. Firms are trying to be more progressive and inclusive. My point essentially is don't think firms narrow down applicants based solely on your university or WAM (albeit your WAM is below 70, though I have heard of a clerk getting into B&B with a passing WAM – not sure at all how he made it).",2025

UTS is known for having multiple choice exams and assignments vs USYD which literally has in-paper and sometimes closed book exams. The rigour of the academic process of these universities should not be discounted. Firms are 100% doing better to take into account disadvantage, which is great. However, I think to say that a 75 is a 75 regardless of where you study in a farce. I do largely agree with the following points, where you study alone will not discount you, however, I do think where you study is part of the consideration process. mikoraiden writes...

As someone who attended a Go8 university and completed almost all assessments through in-person closed/open book exams, I completely understand the frustration and sense of unfairness that can arise when academic marks are not moderated consistently across institutions or formats. However, in practice, I don’t believe this discrepancy plays as significant a role in graduate recruitment outcomes as it may have in the past, even among top-tier firms. For example, here’s stats from a top tier firm who took in around 50 clerks last year. Less than 50% went to USYD/UNSW – still a sizeable amount, but not the domination that you’d once expect for the Sydney process. Over 30% came from universities like UTS, Macquarie, WSU, Wollongong and others, with the remainder from interstate or international institutions. This trend isn’t isolated to just one firm either – similar data patterns can be seen across other firms as well. Of course, this doesn’t mean your university doesn’t matter at all, but perhaps I oversimplified a bit in that it's moreso that the emphasis on institutional prestige isn’t quite as decisive as it once was.",2025

Same thing happened with their BBIB cycle in their third year – one interview, one offer. During clerkship season in their fourth year, they applied to over 20 firms and again received only one interview offer, which was from a T6, which they converted into a clerkship. And finally, when they applied to MBB in their final year, they only got one interview, and yes, turned it into an offer where they've now been working there happily for many years. It sounds beyond ridiculous, I couldn’t make it up even if I tried! I also have many friends who received “only” one or two interviews during clerkships, but still converted those into offers.

That said, I'm speaking as someone who's no longer directly involved so this may longer be accurate, and unfortunately, you're not likely to get many people offering tips or giving you a heads-up advantage on online forums which is understandable, but hopefully this is somewhat of help.",2025

Haven't done C&C AC, but general advice. Brush up on your affidavit skills, email etiquette and legal language. For any group assessment, do not worry about being talked over and focus on getting your point across. Firms prefer those that are collaborative and open-minded as opposed to those that are dismissive. If it's a negotiation exercise, they are not looking at seeing you 'win' but how collaborative each party is in approaching a solution that is in both clients' interests. Not sure if that helps, but I hope you got some insight.",2025

Also add the fact that there is no spell check (the first screen warned if you change windows the assessment would freeze, so can't type in word) and the timer is invisible because the text box needs scrolling the timer off view. Scrolling back and forth to timer adds a few seconds because of the amount of text you have to scroll past. And the text box only shows 2 lines at a time.
