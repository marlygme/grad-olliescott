In answer to your questions: Programs generally range from 9-24 months in length. Within that period most companies offer rotations through different departments of the organisation. If it's a Generalist program then you might be doing rotations through areas you aren't necessarily all that interested in. If it's a Specialist program then it's more likely that you'll be doing rotations through departments relevant to your studies Useful things you learn...again depends on whether it's a Generalist or Specialist program. You'll most likely undergo technical training specific to your job (I'm not really sure what that involves for computer science... you could find more of that specifically on company websites) as well as soft skill training which is more about general business-related skills like organisational networking and leadership and how to write business reports GPA is generally a minimum credit average – i.e. >65. Some companies ask for higher depending on the requirements of the program, but as a general rule it's credit average Some websites which might be handy are www.graduatecareers.com.au and www.unigrad.com.au"

Forum Regular reference: whrl.pl/RbQPRT posted 2009-May-18, 9:26 am AEST ref: whrl.pl/RbQPRT posted 2009-May-18, 9:26 am AEST From my understanding its identifying talented individuals who the org believes can become future leaders. So when you enter a grad program essentially you are expected to advance to managerial positions within a couple of years. You're given a lot more training than non-graduates (leadership, motivational training). You also have a bigger network, given you'll have a mentor and because you've done rotations, networking events etc. So in other words you're handfed a lot of opportunities which non-graduates would most likely have to be real standouts to be able to achieve. Whilst you can still achieve all the things a graduate can achieve without the program, it'll definitely provide you with the best opportunity straight out of uni."

It'll take a weight off your shoulders knowing that you have a job waiting for you when you graduate. Alternatively, you could wait and apply the year after you graduate, and use that extra year to gain work experience and rack up some volunteer work. Most company application forms ask you to list each of your completed subjects and the grade you received, and they determine your current GPA based on that information. If you've done reasonably well in your first 2-3 years at university, GPA should be the least of your worries when it comes to graduate applications."

Many comments on how good grad programs are, come from grads whose entire fulltime work experience is their one grad program in one place. Its taking in people with a degree but no clue, and giving them that clue, so they are moulded exactly as the business wants them. You come out with a degree and knowing how to work in that organisation, how all the parts work etc. Similar to gaining work experience elsewhere and then applying to that business – in that case you already have a proven track record in that job/industry so there's no need for a 1-2 yr program to teach you how things work."

The fact that you go through such a strenuous and competitive recruitment process and fight for one of 120 roles out of 6000 or so applications does say a lot. Employers know this. The best part of the graduate program is the rotations and in any role you start you will be crappy things upon starting – that's what training is.

We also had a lot of technical training as well, to ramp us up in the first 6 months. We had formal training through a universty too. I understand from comments from managment that because of all the training and investment, they don't make their return on you until after 2 years. Which is typically when most young people who have come through a grad program decide to leave (2-4 years). I'd also advise you to check non-graduate program roles. The reason being that graduate programs attract the most candidates, and hence have the most competition. Its what a lot of graduates dream of – working for that big company. I did the same thing.

How graduates are seen is so dependant on the culture of the company. My feeling has been that in the oil industry, graduates are seen as leaders of tomorrow. The upside is graduates are given lots of opportunities to move around and understand how the company works as a whole. The downside is as many of these graduates start out as technical people, they take away with them a lot of technical knowledge each time they move. This means that yes, you have excellent people all being managers, but very little technical experts who have been around for 5+ years. That said, all is not lost as these engineers eventually come back around and end up in their old bosses jobs. This observation is based on working alongside grads from 3 oil giants (I've contract for). In other industries I've worked with (consulting, government run processing facility, private explosives company) sometimes, graduates were treated like poo. They were the gophers of the 'real' engineer. In one company, for 3 years, they retained their ""Graduate Process Engineer"" title, and until they finished their rotation, they were not treated like 'real' engineers. I felt sorry for these as they were usually given the most tedious of the technical jobs and having to constantly prove yourself. I feel that good grad programs have flexibility in rotation, well structured mentoring/support system and regular appraisal/reviews. Pay-wise, grad programs range from 40k to 100k, again dependent on industry."

Its where you get a 25% pay increase after being there after your first year. That is not a typical example.. unfortunately. In the current economic climate, you need to appreciate having a job you can enjoy, before you worry about your first increase. Here is my '2 bob': Grad Programs in Australia are often a structured medium to ease school leavers in to the 'real world'. Dependent on your industry, this might be as simple as having someone oversee you for 3 months, or through to something far more structured. I'm in engineering, and for me that was doing non-technical project work and odd jobs to start with, to get my head around the industry, terminology and what to expect. It also gives you time to find your feet, and work out which area, specialisation, or approach you want to take with your career. For us it's 3-4 years, because that is how long it takes to get Chartered Professional Engineering Status ('CP ENG') in most cases. In most cases, yes, you do get the 'crap' little tedious roles that no one else wants. An odd job here and there isn't bad, and it helps you learn more about the business and industry. I have a friend who was on a grad program, but his only roles involved doing other people's boring tasks, and he missed out on his rotation. This is an example of poor management and is not a graduate program. He changed companies after the first year, and is better for it. When considering a graduate program: 1) Know how long the program is for, and if it is flexible 2) find out if there are rotations, and to WHERE (i.e. are you going to be sent to a remote area for a year?) 3) Find out if there is a mentor or buddy system (VERY useful when first starting out) 4) Apply for all jobs you are legitimately interested in, regardless of GPA/grade requirement, but make sure you know their core business well, and be confident without being cocky. 5) Ensure there will be 'continuous professional development' throughout your graduate program, and throughout your career. These are the best companies to work for, although sometimes the sacrifice is that the pay is not in the top percentile. WHY? — because it is better to have 10 years of experience, rather than having one year of experience, repeated 10 times."

How soon is too soon to mention this job on my resume? You would put it as your 'current employer', in terms of employment experience i.e where you list companies; but if you haven't achieved anything notable within this new position, it may not be work putting into the section of 'work' experience – i.e. where you elaborate your work skills experience for the various positions you have held. The questions are: ""What can I do now, that I couldn't do before I started?"" (for a job just after you finish uni), or ""What skills have I used in this role, that might put me above peers applying for this next role?"" – Then it is worth while putting it in. As soon as you put something on a resume, be prepared to talk about it and provide further information. If the current position is not relevant to your studies, you can still use it as experience, through giving an example on how you have acted on, or advised on safety or management. A good one is giving an example of how you coped and overcame a difficult situation, and have learned from it. The examples are probably more suited for during the interview, unless you have a real 'eye catcher', that would draw their attention to your resume in particular. If you are having trouble with lack of work experience, also note board and other positions held on noteworthy clubs, associations & community groups that demonstrates responsibility. It is never to late to join a group like LIONS ( http://www.lionsclubs.org/EN/find-a-club.php ) or ROTARY, and be involved in the community and hold a position on the board. Good luck with it all.

If that is correct, then you should apply for the graduate positions. Lack of local experience – you will need to elaborate. If you have an overseas qualification, you can apply for 'recognition' for your degree through the government for free. However, Engineers Australia does not recognise this equivalency. Basically, if you have the qualification, and the language, you should be able to use SEEK.COM.AU or equivalent to find the jobs. People apply for jobs interstate & overseas frequently. If you don't have the qualification, or have great difficulty with the language of the country, then you have an immensely large study load ahead if you wish to work as an Engineer in that country."

You can read the fine print, but graduate programs do not usually have any progression beyond the level above graduate. The whole point of most graduate programs, is to simply help graduates 'establish' themselves in their respective industries. You are almost guaranteed to not become the CEO of the company you start in. If it is a very big firm, you will have a lot of politics in your way, and not to mention the imports from other companies. You will also probably require an MBA to consider a role like CEO."

Now that I ve made into a grad program what happens afterwards ? This depends on the conditions of your employment. i.e. are you on a 2 year contract? – and you will have to re-apply after that time? Or have you signed something that states that you will be a manager of some group at the end of your completion? (I imagine this would be rare?) – The trick here is simply to ASK. Keeping in mind, unless it is written into your contract, things can change. Many graduates are taken on as full time permanent employees, and will simply stay on after the program runs its course (i.e. no bonuses or financial acknowledgement). This may be VERY different in some industries. Note I am most familiar with engineering. Do not get your hopes too high for 'what comes next' (regarding management), but keep a clear idea of where you want to go as you will need to 'drive' your career. Sometimes you may be required to be more persistent to get what you want. After my graduate program comes to an end, do I get a pay hike or am I offered a managerial position ? Would it be a good idea to finish a grad program with one company and then apply to a different company and expect to be paid a lot better ? It is not a good idea to 'stick it out' if you are not benefiting from it (i.e. learning a great deal). In the case of engineering graduate programs, they usually are fairly vague. For example they often include 'professional development' talks, training, rotations, and often engineers will often 'drop off the program' when one of the following occurs: You have been in the company more than 4 years (or what ever your company defines) You progress, and your title / pay is beyond that of graduate, You acquire your Chartered Status (Which usually takes about 3.5 years) Many companies offer a bonus and a slight pay rise for those who acquire chartered status. Other employers will simply hold any potential advancement and pay rise, until Chartered status is acquired. In many cases (depending on your industry), you will not get a managerial position at the end of the program. This is because, by in large, a graduate program is to establish a graduate into an industry that they are not familiar with. My understanding of the intent is that when you have finished the graduate program, you should be a 'useful employee' for the more complicated intermediate roles. [i.e. work unsupervised with minimal to no instruction] In terms of money / interest etc, it is very much an 'as you go' self moderation. If you get to a point of stagnation where you are not learning anything, or if you know in all honesty that you are not being acknowledged for the level of work / time etc that you put towards the company, then it is the time to leave. Do not rush the "" expect to be paid a lot better ? "" query. The biggest issue for graduates who get to the point of 'boredom' or just want more money, is bunny hopping to new jobs while the industry is good, to get more pay. Their pay then was greater than their abilities, and they were the first to go (termination of contract, redundancies etc) when the times got tough. I encourage other areas of industry to put forward their 'typical graduate program' examples, as it is likely to differ greatly from the above."

From what I've gathered, science has a different progression and application in terms of a career due to a variety of factors (eg. type of industry, qualifications, type of major/specialisation etc.), but my question is whether graduate programs are available for science graduates in the same way they are for most other fields as stated before? Is it possible for science students to gain work experience in an industry environment (like engineering students, for example) during their studies? Or is this one field where it just isn't possible? I've found that some companies (eg. Pharmaceutical, food/beverage, chemical industries, enviro etc.) offer graduate programs or something of the like, but at times they do specify minimum qualifications (eg. Honours, Masters etc.). So what actually counts as a 'graduate' when it comes to science? Is the term always reliant on the level of qualification required for the position in this case? I would be much appreciated if anyone could answer any of these questions."

Some Graduate programs are excellent — but there are far more companies with programs that aren't the best. Usually you will sacrifice a higher starting wage, to start a company with a good program — but it will pay off in the end.

People accept that the ""grad"" won't know everything and are happy to help you. In terms of what is involved in a grad program... well, that's really hard to say because every company does things differently. One standout program that I've seen is the ABB grad program, which funnily enough doesn't get that much exposure. Sample ABB Grad program > ( http://www.abbaustralia.com. au/cawp/auabb506/8b1aae28b2d 68ae1ca2573f6001a8d57.aspx ) ABB 2013 Grad Program Thread ( /forum-replies.cfm?t=1875344 ) That first link gives you a great idea of one type of grad program. Some companies will offer one single job or project for the duration of your grad program, but unless you know 100% that you want to be there.. you won't find it very enjoyable and will probably get bored. Basically go through each company's website and if there isn't enough info, then call up HR and they should be happy to help. If you can't find HR's number, then try and get to a careers fair. If all else fails, send an email to their contact us page. But do your research! Enjoy :)"

Every rotation you would be working in a different area of ABB working on a different project. But from everything I have been told, its great to go through because then you understand how the whole business runs which then gives you a massive advantage. Not just because you know how all the parts fit together, but also because you have an opportunity to network with people in all the parts of the company which is extremely beneficial. And 4 months is a good period of time where you can get some experience and move on before it gets boring. It's also quite flexible in terms of what projects you can work on so you can push to do certain projects and work on certain teams. Hope that helps!"

Most public servants often confuse grads with indigenous cadets, or work experience school kids. Essentially, the mindset from most public servants (who just start their careers 2 to 3 levels higher in the deparment without going thru a grad program and often with no real qualifications), is that graduate programs are opportunities for kids transitioning from school to their first job in maccas etc. No effort is spent to educate general staff that graduate program candidates actually have skills, qualifications or even work experience. Mature aged grads are often thought of as 'slow starters', and unspoken opinions appear to be, hmmm he must not have had the opportunity to study when he was young, he must have gone to jail and become reformed then went to Uni, or he must have been a refugee who learnt to read and write in Australia and is now looking for his first employment role. When advertising graduate programs however, departments spare no expense and the intense competition leads each and every subsequent grad cohort to think the following: 1) Competition for places was exceptionally difficult this year. 2) We must be really special because it was really really difficult to get in."

Forgot to mention, i'm a Computer Scientist to be graduate. Hi, I'm a graduate with Suncorp and I guess I can answer your question. A graduate is someone who just finished their university studies and has a fresh eye on everything in a work place. Companies invest in graduates because they think graduates challenge the norm, and has the ability to make great changes. Different companies will offer different graduate positions and also different lengths of contract, but most are 2 years. Although most companies have a very specific structure in recruiting graduates, once you get in the door there really isn't much structure in teaching you. What you learn and how your career progresses depend strongly on yourself. Regarding GPA, again, different companies value GPA more and some less. Some companies hire you for your personality and attitude, whereas some see your GPA being the most important qualifying factor. In saying that, you should have at least a GPA of 5. Let me know if you got any other questions, I'll try answer as best I can."

I was told that I was very ""lucky"" and ""talented"". Actually I was gullible. I was forced to work for a long time in an unlucky untalented bad job and I couldn't quit because they had tricked me into signing a fixed duration contract. I couldn't leave until the expiry of the contract. About ""Psychometric Testing"" and other online tests they make you do — for *some* graduate programs, it doesn't matter how you answer. Sometimes they don't even look at the results of your tests. So why do they make you do these online tests if they don't care about the results? They make us do these tests in order to make us feel special and privileged when we seem to pass the test. We worry about the test, later we receive an email saying ""Congratulations!! You passed the test and you are successful onto the next round!"" But sometimes they send the congratulations/success email to everyone — yes EVERYONE passes the test. It's all slowly leading to the ultimate goal of convincing you to stay in a boring or bad job for a much longer time than you would normally choose to. Another goal is reducing recruitment costs by convincing a large number of people to attend group interviews — this is much cheaper to run than individual interviews. But the difficulty with group interviews is that many people don't bother attending the group interview, they know it's usually a waste of time. In order to convince people to attend the group interview, the recruiter uses a long fake application process so that by the time the group interview date arrives, you feel that you have invested so much time/effort into the whole process that you feel you should attend the group interview. The recruiters don't care about wasting the time of hundreds of people. Sometimes they ask you to submit an video of yourself. They may or may not watch the video you make. A friend of mine uploaded an insulting video but got selected for the next round anyway. Most likely my friend was not really ""selected"" — actually the recruiter ""selected"" everyone. They were just trying to convince a whole bunch of graduates to attend a huge ""group interview""."

Sounds a bit ridiculous...... Well it feels like it has a sound grounding in psychology either potentially explained with cognitive dissonance or scarcity ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki /Scarcity_%28social_psychology%29 ). If the graduate believes they had beaten a lot of people and that the job is scare they will likely value it higher than they should which may lead to them staying on more than they would've had they thought it wasn't. It's actually directly mentioned in that page I quote, Numerous studies have been conducted on the topic of scarcity in social psychology. One of which sought to examine the effects of scarcity rhetoric in a job advertisement for restaurant server positions. Subjects were presented with two help-wanted ads. One of which suggested numerous job vacancies, while the other suggested that very few were available. The study found that subjects who were presented with the advertisement that suggested limited positions available viewed the company as being a better one to work for than the one that implied many job positions were available. Subjects also felt that the advertisement that suggested limited vacancies translated to higher wages. In short, subjects placed a positive, higher value on the company that suggested that there were scarce job vacancies available.[3] However all the graduate programs I've seen appear to be pretty great. Do not take this comment as an endorsement of what auras818 said I am just saying that their premise does not sound ridiculous at all and actually may work in the company's favor to increase retention [In the nice theoretical framework of psychology, I'm not sure how well it actually works in real life once people who are truly great start getting offers elsewhere]"

I was wondering if anyone who has gone through a graduate program... There are various forms of grad ""programs"" including misnomers. I didn't go thru one myself but have worked closely with those in one. The grads were sent to different operating centres for 6-mth stints to gain an overall understanding of the company operations. There they were given mini-projects of sufficient difficulty to teach but not overwhelm them. After two years depending on available vacancies they were either assigned to a regular position at an op centre or absorbed into the central department at head office. Shouldn't be called a Program if there's no roadmap for their continued employment. If some grads are let go it's due to their poor performance or occasionally part of a companywide downsizing. Although I suspect a number not getting a desired regular position would also start looking elsewhere, but at least with the 2 years training they stand better chance than those without. In my view there's a clear distinction btwn a grad position and one in a grad program. In a large company each dept manager must prepare & be approved by Executives upstairs for an annual budget in advance. They account for thus need to justify cost vs productivity of a grad position, whereas in-program grads are not charged to their dept but to the Program's budget. Dept managers don't answer for in-program grads' productivity, only on how much training they have acquired."

So I spent most of 2015 travelling around Australia and abroad, and completed an accounting certificate that gave me austudy income. It's now 2016 (obviously) and the lure of full-time work (or should I say, the lure of the pay) is becoming quite appealing to me. Having said that, I've well and truly missed all the grad programs for this year so I've enrolled into a design diploma at TAFE. Is it worth applying for grad programs when they start advertising them this year and trying to land a job starting in 2017? Or is it too late for me (already 27) and will the fact I'm currently studying at TAFE and doing nothing with my international studies/arts university degree work against me? Alternatively, if I thoroughly enjoy the design diploma, could I apply for grad programs next year, when I am in the final year of my diploma, whilst also applying for design jobs, and then take which ever one is most appealing? Or am I going to be too late? I guess I come from a somewhat laid-back, ""alternative"" upbringing so I've never felt any pressure to get a degree and get full-time work. Instead I've lived abroad, learnt foreign languages, used public transport and lived off of youth allowance, etc. But now that I am warming to the idea of a career I worry that my ""relaxed"" history in terms of work and study is going to work against me. I graduated with a really high GPA though I'm now worried it's somewhat useless given it was back in 2014 and I may not be considered eligible for many of the grad programs on offer this year/next year."

Honestly, with grad programs once any pre-employment checks such as police/referee/baseline clearances are done and you have a verbal offer, I think that you just have to take rely on that, presuming it is your first preference. Obviously, the longer the grad program has been around and its reputation probably play into that as well."

If I choose an offer from one place, I would want others to have my spot in the other application places. Honestly, with grad programs once any pre-employment checks such as police/referee/baseline clearances are done and you have a verbal offer, I think that you just have to take rely on that, presuming it is your first preference. Just to check, how about when the process is at the pre-employment checks stage? Is it still not confirmed yet as it would be in a verbal offer? It feels like with pre-employment checks, it's something they do once they already have decided on their candidates?"

The main reason is the sheer number of applications they need to process. Deepest they may go is a police check which would only look into convictions. In terms of checking references, they'll likely only contact references you have on your resume as its convenient. The big take away is most of these graduate recruiters just don't have the time to go that deep. If you're applying for a government agency the background checks will be deeper. Same for the ATO. I wouldn't stress about a bad relationship with a previous employer! Maybe just leave that experience off the resume or take them off as a referee,"

It really depends on the employer and the resources they have/are willing to spend on you. For example, some of the bigger grad programs (e.g. Federal government) have been known to fly candidates across the country to attend Assessment centres and/or interviews. Try and negotiate with them and see if you can do your interview over Teams/video/phone interview. I know that in some grad recruitment panels do almost everything online."

This is honestly quite normal and it is extremely disheartening, butt don't let that stop you from applying! There are many things out of your control when it comes to the recruitment process, but there are a few spots where you have control: 1) Your application – the standard these days is the submission of an online form, and your resume. You directly control the content that goes in there, so do your best to put your best foot forward. Put on paper your work experience, your technical experience, and thee things you've learned from them. Some programs will also require you to write a pitch: ""why should we pick you over another person"" or ""what do you bring to the table?"" These are generally one pagers that allow you to tailor your skills, experience, and background to the recruitment panel. Do your research on the company, look for what sorts of person/skills they are looking for. Understand what they DO and how you can use your skills to further that. 2) Your interview – if your application succeeds and you get an interview, think about the examples you can give the interviewer. My biggest tip is this: ANSWER THE QUESTION. Use your knowledge gained from researching the position to tailor your answer to the types of things that they might ask. Show a depth of understanding rather than generic answers. Grad programs are fairly lenient in the interviews, and the hardest part is actually getting a spot at the Assessment Centre. Once you get to the AC stage, there are many variables that you can't control so the best you can do is play it by ear; prepare as much as you can but ultimate the AC is there to weed out people with poor social/people skills."

It's hard to answer the question though... panic ^^; If you are finding it hard to answer questions, my biggest tip would be to simply take like 10 seconds to think and consider what the question is asking before answering. 10 seconds might sound like a long time, but as an interviewer on the panel, we prefer the candidate provide a considered response that covers the various aspects of the question instead of a quick and rushed answer. Many candidates just rush out an incoherent answer, and then having to do a circular answer (where you repeat bits you already said, or your answer went on a tangent before coming back to it). For example, a question might be: ""How do you respond to failure? Tell us about a time you failed: what happened, and how did you handle it?"" Using the example above, what would your response be? As an exercise, read through the question once, and immediately say your answer out loud to yourself. Then, read it again but this time think for 10 seconds before answering – how has your answer changed? There are multiple parts to this question which you can apply the STAR method to, and you will need to answer all four parts for it to be a full answer. If you take some time to actually consider the question and plan a response, it suddenly becomes much easier to elaborate on your answer."

Chances are they won't kick you out or terminate your employment on a whim, but they have the avenues to do so if warranted.

After your interview, you will need to provide two references within seven days. Afterwards, everybody who passes to a certain degree will be merit-pooled, and you can choose your preference of team and location, but this is not a guarantee of a job. After all of this, starting late August, they will contact preferred candidates for the positions, and then until October, you will have a chance of receiving a verbal offer for the job."

My AC was a group activity where we had to work together to present some key points/recommendations about a topic to the interviewers, and also answer some questions we were given (from memory). The second part of the AC was an interview with 2(3?) people asking questions that need a STAR format answer (Situation, Task, Action, Result). It was a fair while ago when I did my interview set so things could have changed now, and I believe I saw that they are changing the way they do the hiring process for 2026 cohort, so some things may be different for you. I would just recommend to look at STAR questions online, find/remember a suitable situation from your current or past workplaces, and see how you can adapt that situation to fulfill the STAR method criteria. ChatGPT is really helpful for this (that's what I did). My interview contained 0 technical questions that were related to my degree but again, they said they are changing the hiring process for the 2026 cohort so maybe they will ask this time around, I'm not sure."

For example, if you are doing a mathematics degree, regardless of what they say you are obviously most suited for the mathematics stream and have best chance of getting offer for that instead of the science stream lets say. Edit – you are considered for all except intelligence, intelligence is only if you chose it as your preferred and another thing, if you choose intelligence you are also considered for the rest of the streams."

Emails to notify if you get accepted into insight where sent out on 10 May last year. (Program was on 22 May). Around 30-40 people got selected to attend, and from the insight 10 got offered spots for Summer. Performance during program doesn’t matter imo, but best is to be proactive in the group workshops during insight day and in the Q&A panel seshes. Fairly certain most people who attended the insight program received a 1st round interview. There is a video interview component you have to do which is the next step after insight day – however I don’t think these are scrutinised heavily by the campus recruiter. I butchered mine and still got invited to 1st and then 2nd round interviews. As a tip, the VI from BofA is the exact same as what’s on WSO in their VI guide."

This shift is happening alongside increasing competition for a limited number of high-paying roles. My key advice to students in their earlier years is simple: it is never too early to start preparing and networking. With the rise of institutions like Finma and the growing number of cadetship and early insight programs, the traditional recruitment windows are shrinking. As a result, those relying solely on the old timelines risk falling behind. To stay competitive, it's crucial to start building relationships and developing technical skills well ahead of time. It’s also important to note that the nature of technical interviews is evolving. Questions from guides like the ""400 Questions"" book are now considered baseline knowledge. Success in interviews increasingly depends on a deeper conceptual understanding rather than rote memorisation. Lastly, don’t let fear or self-consciousness stop you from reaching out to bankers early in your university journey. You might feel it’s “too soon” or “awkward,” but in reality, no one is judging. As long as you're prepared, curious, and respectful of their time, professionals are often more than happy to support you. TLDR: The competition is only getting tougher — start early, build real understanding, and don't be afraid to put yourself out there."

In Australia GS, UBS and Macap are regarded as the best and most lucrative internships. The other key bulge bracket banks that operate in Aus are Morgan Stanley, JPM (who are rising as a ket player in AUS) and BOFA. There is also a local bank called Barrenjoey who have performed well since their inception a few years ago and is also a lucrative internship in Australia. Other bulge bracket banks who are well known in the US are Citi and Detschue Bank, however, they are not as lucratuve when it comes to the internship process. There are numerous boutiques in AUS. Key players include -> Stanton road, Gresham partners, Grant Samuel,Record Point, Lazard, Flagstaff etc. These are also lucractive and high paying. However, obviosuly not as well known and 'prestigious' as your top 3 BB."

Actually somewhat to the contrary. Comp for GS Grad (which is argugably the best internship) actually recieve lower comp than competitors such as UBS and BOFA. Additionally, boutiques often pay more than BB. On your point re prestige, it is only imporant to the extent you care about PE exisits. Although, often you get more responsibility at boutiques PE firms often prefer those from BB. Here 'prestige' does play a role."

However, I’ve since re-evaluated my perspective, particularly after observing recent deal activity and considering long-term career development. In my view, JPMorgan now deserves a place above Macquarie when assessing internships from a career perspective for Australian students. As highlighted in a recent AFR article, JPMorgan has advised on some of the largest and most strategic transactions in the market, including the Santos and ADNOC deal. When you combine this with JPM’s unmatched global presence and strong reputation in the US, the long-term mobility and international exposure it offers arguably outweigh Macquarie’s strong domestic footprint. While some might argue that names like BofA or Morgan Stanley should rank higher based on their global standing, I think it’s important to weigh that against their presence and deal activity in Australia. On that front, they tend to sit outside the top tier. So if I were building an IB ""starting five"" based on the Australian market, I’d say the Big 4 are clear: 1. Goldman Sachs (LeBron James) – the undisputed GOAT, combining elite global execution with prestige and consistency 2. UBS (Nikola Jokić) – technically elite, unassuming but incredibly effective, and always involved in major plays with huge impact 3. JPMorgan (Jayson Tatum) – rising fast, with global range and increasing leadership in local transactions 4. Macquarie (Patty Mills) – the Aussie veteran, proven performer in its home court with strong institutional trust The rest are still on the bench, waiting for more minutes. Open to thoughts , curious to hear how others would rank their top picks. FYI this is just for a bit of fun, all internships are good!"

Hi, just had a question. What is the interbank period? And haven't most investment banks finished their interviews for summer internship? Thanks. @zinup – my understanding, happy to be corrected, interbank is basically an agreement amongst banks to hire summer interns and conduct interviews from Interbank day. I think this is an agreement held by most BB IBs. You are correct in saying a lot of the boutique investment banks have already completed recruiting for summer internships. Has anyone received email for psychometrics for Grant Samuel Syd? @gabber – I am pretty sure Grant Samuel has finished recruiting, based on this forum. Could be wrong. Not sure if they have psychometrics as part of their process, most of the boutiques usually don't."

To be honest, I’m not entirely sure about the long-term viability of going into markets straight after undergrad. If I were seriously considering it, I’d either go all-in and try to break into quant, where the compensation is strong early on, or opt for IB, which offers far better exit opportunities. From my perspective, markets roles seem incredibly competitive for jobs that don’t really lead to many exits. I could be completely off here, so happy to be challenged if others see it differently."

I did have my camera on initially to present myself professionally, but then while performing each assessment I had myself muted and camera off, no issues. Each assessment is 40 minutes, 45 to be safe and allow for introduction to the task etc. Both tasks (Digital and Generalist) were written tasks. The meeting room does not automatically close, you are simply expected to stop work once the time limit expires and upload it to the candidate portal. It's all very straightforward and not too dissimilar from a supervised assessment at uni. Definitely had fun with this one once I got in!"

Does anyone who was successful have any advice about the written assessment that you felt contributed to your success? I already try to apply the STAR method, although I’m sure I could strengthen that skill with some practice. Also, those who were successful, what’s your level of experience/education in data science? I’m wondering if I need to pivot towards applying for Digital streams, as my degree was only partially focussed on data/statistics, and my data science work experience is somewhat limited."

A mistake because the AI checking the work would give less points for work done by humans working against the clock. I have a hard time believing HR is reading hundreds of written assessments. Well one way or another clearly my non-AI generated work made the cut, because I was invited to the AC. I'd be very surprised if they weren't reading the majority, as they have a recruitment contractor to help and they put it in the assessment that AI should not be used. This tells me that anyone with *too much* content, didn't make the cut, as having too much content at a high standard is a great indicator of AI usage. After all, nobody is perfect, and the time limit is designed to challenge the candidate while still being enjoyable. Another example which I'm yet to find out if it's a success or not, is the AGGP STEM stream written assessment. In this assessment, I was able to submit a quality response but only completed 2 out of the 4 parts. I'm betting this is not going to be an issue to any reasonable person. Depends on what they're after."

Even after being placed in the merit pool- because services Australia requires their graduates to do a three month service delivery, some decline their offer as other grad roles don’t do this or for other reasons such as relocations, hence accepting another offer in another APS down the line. So maybe more chance for merit pool candidates in services Australia to get a VO. Of course this is just my understanding. I’ve read previous forums from the past couple years for services Australia and don’t see that many people get VO unfortunately. But of course every year is different. There may be more openings this year compared to last. Who knows."

It’s pretty straight forward if you know the design process particularly accessibility and understanding how to proceed with research. There’s a question that’ll give you features and how you can iterate on the design to meet accessibility needs and UX needs, another where you respond to an email with a client prompt with questions to understand their issue and another with a results chart from user testing where you give your report on the findings. Personally, think it’s miles better than doing a psychometric test that has barely any bearing on design work. Good luck!"

Honestly, the work is a lot better than I expected. The work culture is super chill and the pay is surpringsly good for a grad role. My online assessment last year was a one on one panel interview with 4 people on the panel. They asked 4-5 behavioral questions and we were given material one hour before the interview to prepare a presentation. After that, if you did well you would get placed in a merit pool and then its more of a luck game. From what a remember, there were more than 700 people in the merit pool and around 350ish got offers. But that was because last years budget was a lot smaller than previous years. But best of luck to everyone :)"

I would suggest you to practice a short introduction about yourself question and question relating to what skills/experience you can bring to the grad role based on the skills listed in the advertisement (work experience, uni clubs, degree field, volunteer experience, self learning modules you did) – not just vague but actually practice speaking exactly why you are essentially a better candidate to be hired than others who have applied and sell yourself.

After that, they asked one general question and four behavioural ones, and then followed up a bit more on two of them. The panel had two people and they are actually really sweet and made the whole vibe super chill. They explained everything clearly at the start and made me feel really comfortable, so it didn’t feel too formal or intense at all. Best of luck to whoever has their interview left. :)"

Each hiring manager has varying workloads, so emails may be sent in batches without seemingly any logical order, more so based on when your batch is completed.

Anyone else from Gosford? Seems like they are having a hard time deciding who they want to put in the merit pool, likely because of competitive interviews this year or hiring constraints? which means they are really trying to raise the bar for a final shortlist and double check numbers/candidates suitability. Last year almost everyone who was merit pooled followed up on last years thread saying they received an offer. After the interviews last year they sent out either rejection or merit pool emails pretty much at the same time. My interview this year was so much better than last year, and I still felt it would be unlikely I got a merit pool this time around considering all this messaging. Interviewed for AGGP as well – probably my best interview ever and still received a rejection. Tough year"

The intakes in 2023 and 2024 were quite large, and they had both a mid-year intake and a normal intake. In 2025 however, the grad cohort was significantly smaller and with just 1 intake. I've heard from reliable sources that the grad intake for 2026 is going to be even smaller than 2025. All this to say – keep your expectations low and continue applying for other roles and other programs. Its a tough hiring year but there will definitely be something good around the corner for all of you, it just might not be at the ATO."

But it’s different to last year, they’re doing it before merit pool offers which seems like they are looking to reduce/revise the list somehow. Some people may have offers elsewhere or are no longer available, especially with the delay… a few top candidates might have secured positions elsewhere. I’d hope the reference calls are just to check APS suitability and consistency with the interview/application. Assuming you didn’t lie/over exaggerate skills at any stage of your application and your references endorse you well you should still be suitable after a reference check – getting to this stage already means they liked your interview/application. Lots of APS grad interviews have a 20-50% success rate from what I’ve heard, they’ve already heavily shortlisted candidates at the interview stage… I’d say making it to a reference check stage like this pushes those odds up to 50-80% (assuming they give out rejections as well). But I also can’t be certain why they’re doing this, so I’m not entirely sure :/"

The interview was mostly behavioral as in 'tell me about yourself', 'if you were trying to explain something technical to a non technical person how would you go about it', 'If you are learning something new how would you approach it'. There was some specific questions like which intake you wish to undertake, are you available to work on premises, your working rights etc. The phone interview was only 15mins. They said that next weeks interview is more comprehensive (45mins) where you they ask more questions about you and also ask you to demonstrate your understanding through a recent project (I'm kinda cooked on this aspect)."

But back then, people generally understood that G+T supposedly used AI to scan our cover letters and other materials for key words to progress candidates for psychometric testing. With ChatGPT and other advancements now, I’d imagine things have evolved quite a bit since then! Hope this helps. :)"

That said, the whole process for all the firms can be pretty arbitrary and can be incredibly non-sensical and unfair at times (as I keep reminding my friend who is going through the process this year who reminded me about Whirlpool after all this time). While there might be general rules of thumb, there are always going to be exceptions to the rule, so you just have to try not to drive yourself too crazy reading into it all too much and just know none of it is a genuine reflection on your self-worth or whether you will succeed in commercial law. :)"

Take this with a grain of salt as it's just my two cents but it's common for people to RSVP “yes” to multiple events and attend portions of each. In the meantime, it’s a good idea to reach out to the organisers and ask whether recordings will be available for any parts you might miss due to other information sessions scheduled that evening. You don’t need to mention which firms, as that’s honestly none of their business, but do clarify that the conflict is due to overlapping information nights, so they don’t mistakenly assume it’s a work/uni-related absence."

Things like being responsive over email, showing reasonable availability (we don’t expect you to clear your schedules by any means but it doesn’t leave a great impression when candidates say their only availability in the next three weeks is 31 July 2025 5:55pm to 6:10pm), and being present and engaged during interactions does make a difference. While these informal touchpoints typically aren’t deal-breakers on their own, they do form part of the broader impression we provide back to the recruitment team. We’re generally asked to report back on things like attitude, preparedness, and overall enthusiasm. Turning up late to a one-on-one catchup, asking silly questions that could have been Googled beforehand at an information evening, or drinking too much at a networking event and calling a partner a corporate square (just why?!) is going to leave a negative impression, especially when compared to candidates who are making the effort. That said, life happens, and extenuating circumstances are absolutely understood. For example, I knew someone who had to miss a few sessions after getting their wisdom teeth removed – HR across multiple firms made it abundantly clear they didn’t want them showing up fresh out of surgery. Firms also know that you’ll have competing events – it’s about the overall effort and attitude. So if something comes up, don’t stress, just make sure to communicate clearly and proactively. The main thing is that under no circumstances should you fail to follow up after committing to attend or ghost them hoping it'll go unnoticed. It not only comes across as disrespectful to those who’ve set aside time for you, it gives the impression that you’re unreliable or do not follow through on your word (which is at the end of the day, all we've really got)."

I’m definitely not an expert in recruitment but was lucky enough to progress despite weaker grades. It probably depends on how you portrayed your t6 experience – did you take on “substantive” responsibilities in a “substantive” team (used very loosely). E.g., perhaps a paralegal role in the DR team may have given you more exposure to drafting/research than an intern role in one of the technology teams – not saying you don’t learn much in these teams, I’m sure you did and you will, but you’d likely do more research or drafting in the DR team (again, comes down to how you portray your experience). I’ve also been told other factors may include your ECs (did you have leadership positions or do comps) and whether you demonstrated a genuine interest in the application, sometimes saying “I’m really interested in X” isn’t enough, you’d probably have to mention an ongoing case the firm’s taking, who the partner taking the lead is and why that case is interesting to you. - Just my two cents, probably doesn’t mean much but hope it helps you get a peace of mind. I also don’t think the “oh that firm only hires a certain type” is a good mentality to have. I’m sure most don’t."

That said, these are absolutely not hard cut-offs, just rough guidelines. The perception that being at a Go8 university gives you an edge is outdated (as someone who went to one, this isn’t a cope). Firms are increasingly aware that university choice is often shaped by access and privilege at the high school level, and they don't moderate marks based on your university. A 75 is a 75, regardless of where you studied. For those who don’t believe me, if you stalk previous recent clerk cohorts at the big firms on LinkedIn, you’ll see a really sizeable portion did not study at a Go8. In terms of work experience, firms generally just want to see that you’ve had some – it doesn’t need to be with a T6 firm or even a legal role. They’re aware that highly sought-after paralegal experience can sometimes come down to nepotism or connections, and they don’t necessarily see it as a marker of pure merit (that is not to say you haven’t worked hard, it’s just something to keep in mind – on LinkedIn, you can see a lot of summer clerks have only worked in hospitality/retail before commencing). In fact, if you already have a T6 paralegal role or are perceived as highly likely to go to the best firms, some firms might choose not to invest time interviewing you (as for partners, they’re forgoing $1,000ph), as they’re trying to protect their yield and conversion rates. Furthermore, you also don’t need to have elite-level extracurriculars like Jessup mooting or Law Journal. For example, I know someone who received multiple top-tier offers whose application centred around their passion as a pole dancing instructor. Firms just want to see some engagement outside of your studies. Once you've met the basic thresholds – a reasonable WAM, some work experience, and some form of extracurricular involvement – one of the biggest differentiators becomes the quality of your written application. Crafting strong applications are an art in themselves and the writing style is quite specific and can take time to master, so please do not beat yourself up, it’s not a reflection on you or your capabilities or potential. It’s also true that each firm tends to look for a certain type of candidate – not just in terms of qualifications, but personality and “fit”. The best analogy I can offer is that it’s a bit like fraternity or sorority rush – while the process may seem uniform on the surface, each firm has its own distinct culture and tends to gravitate toward a specific “vibe” in candidates eg. one firm I'm thinking of tends to take nerds who are the type to genuinely enjoy talking about constitutional law at lunch, another firm I'm thinking of has a big work hard party hard culture and is quite jock-y in their intake etc."

My friend who clerked at KWM last year went to MQ with a WAM of 74. While she had extensive legal experience at a Mid-tier firm and extra-curricular, she actually received offers from all of the T06 except Allens. I'm not too sure what recruiters are genuinely looking for, but thinking a firm only accepts a TO8 University (UTS isn't that far behind), is a pretty outdated view, I'm pretty sure Allens in the only firm that cares about that. Firms are trying to be more progressive and inclusive. My point essentially is don't think firms narrow down applicants based solely on your university or WAM (albeit your WAM is below 70, though I have heard of a clerk getting into B&B with a passing WAM – not sure at all how he made it)."

UTS is known for having multiple choice exams and assignments vs USYD which literally has in-paper and sometimes closed book exams. The rigour of the academic process of these universities should not be discounted. Firms are 100% doing better to take into account disadvantage, which is great. However, I think to say that a 75 is a 75 regardless of where you study in a farce. I do largely agree with the following points, where you study alone will not discount you, however, I do think where you study is part of the consideration process. mikoraiden writes...

Once you've met the basic thresholds – a reasonable WAM, some work experience, and some form of extracurricular involvement, one of the biggest differentiators becomes the quality of your written application. Crafting strong applications are an art in themselves and the writing style is quite specific and can take time to master, so please do not beat yourself up, it’s not a reflection on you or your capabilities or potential."

As someone who attended a Go8 university and completed almost all assessments through in-person closed/open book exams, I completely understand the frustration and sense of unfairness that can arise when academic marks are not moderated consistently across institutions or formats. However, in practice, I don’t believe this discrepancy plays as significant a role in graduate recruitment outcomes as it may have in the past, even among top-tier firms. For example, here’s stats from a top tier firm who took in around 50 clerks last year. Less than 50% went to USYD/UNSW – still a sizeable amount, but not the domination that you’d once expect for the Sydney process. Over 30% came from universities like UTS, Macquarie, WSU, Wollongong and others, with the remainder from interstate or international institutions. This trend isn’t isolated to just one firm either – similar data patterns can be seen across other firms as well. Of course, this doesn’t mean your university doesn’t matter at all, but perhaps I oversimplified a bit in that it's moreso that the emphasis on institutional prestige isn’t quite as decisive as it once was."

I know someone who’s always been an exceptional candidate with outstanding stats, but not the strongest when it comes to navigating written applications. When applying to the Big 4 accounting firms in their second year, they landed just one interview from a firm, but converted it to an offer. Same thing happened with their BBIB cycle in their third year – one interview, one offer. During clerkship season in their fourth year, they applied to over 20 firms and again received only one interview offer, which was from a T6, which they converted into a clerkship. And finally, when they applied to MBB in their final year, they only got one interview, and yes, turned it into an offer where they've now been working there happily for many years. It sounds beyond ridiculous, I couldn’t make it up even if I tried! I also have many friends who received “only” one or two interviews during clerkships, but still converted those into offers. It can feel incredibly disheartening, especially when you see others posting about having 10+ interviews, but this actually happens far more often than you’d think so please try not to lose hope!"

A few years ago, for example, one of the questions was 'What is your most embarrassing moment?'. They tend to include a question like that every year to showcase your personality and see how well you can think on your feet, rather than flogging x4 standard behaviourals. That said, I'm speaking as someone who's no longer directly involved so this may longer be accurate, and unfortunately, you're not likely to get many people offering tips or giving you a heads-up advantage on online forums which is understandable, but hopefully this is somewhat of help."

Haven't done C&C AC, but general advice. Brush up on your affidavit skills, email etiquette and legal language. For any group assessment, do not worry about being talked over and focus on getting your point across. Firms prefer those that are collaborative and open-minded as opposed to those that are dismissive. If it's a negotiation exercise, they are not looking at seeing you 'win' but how collaborative each party is in approaching a solution that is in both clients' interests. Not sure if that helps, but I hope you got some insight."

I have a background in Computer Science/Data and applied to three Deloitte grad streams: Data Analytics Engineering & AI Sustainability & Industrial Engineering I’m mainly interested in the first two, and only applied for the Sustainability stream as a backup/practice. I submitted my applications fairly late. So far, only the Sustainability stream has progressed (currently at Assessment Centre stage), while the other two have been stuck at “Psychometric testing completed” since the 14th of this month. Today I got a call from a Deloitte staff member inviting me to the AC for the Sustainability stream, but she also mentioned that my other two applications will be put on hold. Does anyone know exactly when that hold kicks in? Was it triggered when I received the VI invitation on the 14th? (If that’s the case, maybe the other two still had a chance but now it might be too late?) Or does the hold start now, only because they’ve called me for the AC? Given this situation, would it be too risky to politely decline the AC invite for the Sustainability stream and hope my preferred streams (Data Analytics or Eng & AI) still have a chance to move forward? Would really appreciate any insights or advice from someone who’s gone through something similar!!"

They explained the case brief (for which they sent supplementary resources prior to the AC day) and gave us 45 minutes to work together and come up with solutions/ideas to present. Then after presenting, they asked a bunch of questions but I'm pretty sure they really only assess how well you worked together as a group/how much of a team player you were.

It's really based on the team and how fast they want to process you. i.e. they might have the meeting to decide who to choose straight away after the interview or the following week. If anyone is reading this and is worried because the firms have not contacted them yet, DO NOT WORRY. From what I know the process can take up to many days, but most likely you will find out within 7- 10 business days (and some cases maybe longer)."

Feeling… dejected. 98 ATAR, 93 WAM, recipient of 107k scholarship, and I had 4 internships at noteworthy institutions internationally, amongst other accomplishments. Didn’t even make it to the phone or psychometric stage. Friends I know got in the summer and winter programs with objectively less astounding records (by their own accounts). Only variables that differ is that I attended a non-G8 institution (didn’t have the degree I was interested in) and I’m older, being a mature age student. Is there anyone else with a similar experience?"

Didn’t even make it to the phone or psychometric stage. It could be that there was something that you didn't meet with the first stage of the application. Usually how it goes is: fill in details about yourself (like uploading resume, etc) -> psych assessment -> phone screen -> AC -> Offer. The psych and phone could sometimes be swapped in that process. More info here: https://www.macquarie.com/au/ en/careers/recruitment-process.html The fact that you didn't get the psych assessment/phone interview may mean that there was some requirement you didn't meet when you were filling in the initial application details. I am not sure what that would be though. Are you a penultimate student? Also, when did you apply? If you applied closer to the closing date of the apps, you have a lower chance of moving forward than those who applied earlier because they look at applicants at a rolling basis. So if you did apply late, then you are in risk being overlooked if decisions have already been made. Anyway, you should contact them to ask why you were rejected. So you can know what requirements you are not meeting (if any) or if it's because you applied closer to the end date (if you did) or if it's due to something else that you can fix/get around for future apps."

The ones that didn't get any positions and remained in the Merit Pool didn't get notified until like Feb 2025.

So even if you get offered in october you still have enough time to get clearance before the program starts in february. I think another issue they had last year was too many people in the merit pool, might also explain why group assessment and interview happened in separate stages, they are probably trying to minimise the amount of people in the merit pool so they have less to deal with/it will be easier to give out offers."

As offers last year were also meant to come out around August from memory, but nothing happened until like October/November. Not sure how it's running this year, but last year you chose the groups you were interested in when you applied (i.e. if you wanted DSTG, you would put down DSTG as part of your application and your group assessment/interview was also with that group). But yeah hope for you guys that they stick to the timelines this year, as there's nothing worse than not knowing, especially not knowing when to expect an offer either."

If so, if you haven't received anything back within 24 hours, I am pretty sure it means you have been rejected. Checked the last years intake and they apparently received their outcomes/updates after each OA within 24 hours. And even after some hours E.g., after filling in the application on the 5th I think, pretty sure within the next 24/48 hours, I got the invitation to complete the game based assessment. Then after some hours later, I got the invitation to do the personality questionnaire. I did the personality questionnaire yesterday. I know it hasn't been 24 hours yet but I received invitations to the OA tests within a few hours, like between 7am-8am. And checked my emails today, no emails. So I think I have been rejected based on my personality responses. But who knows, maybe it's different this year but if we are going from last year's intake, if you don't get a response on your OA tests within 24/48 hours, then most likely you have been rejected. Can someone who got a response after the personality questionnaire confirm? Did you get a response/update within 24/48 hours? Or did it take longer than that? I will give an update if I hear anything back."

I got it within 48 hours. If you haven't, try emailing them. The next stage after submitting the app consists of you recording yourself where you need to draw experiences from work/school/from whatever to answer scenario based questions. Then after the recordings, you will play game based assessments. They are easy to do, they are not highly technical but you have a time limit and you have to try and do them as much as you can within the time limit. But don't rush because you want to get them correct too, do them as correct and quickly as you can. Just make sure you understand the rules of the games. Then after the game based assessments, you should get a personality questionnaire within 48 hours. After completing the personality questionnaire, according to their site, the next stage is interview prep but I am not sure what that is. After that, it's face to face interview. I am not sure when we are supposed to get the interview prep after the personality questionnaire. I have done the personality questionnaire but haven't heard anything back. If someone has gotten an email after the personality questionnaire, it would be cool to know here when you got an email. Cos that would then pretty much confirm that people who didn't get a response within X hours means that they are not moving forward. Oh and this is specifically for the technology stream, so I am not sure if the process and the timing of things are different for other streams."

If you scroll down to ""Application Process"" in here: https://www.anz.com.au/career s/career-programs/summer-internship/ , stage 2 is digital interview and game based assessment. The game based assessment consists of 4 games. 3 of the games are testing your technical skills. But the 4th game is a personality quiz. If you passed stage 2, then you should get an invite to do the personality questionnaire (stage 3). So you have to do a personality quiz in stage 2, which is represented as a game but you have to do another personality quiz in stage 3. So, have you done both the personality quizzes from stage 2 and stage 3? If so, you got them together in the same email? If so, that's not the usual process. Regardless, as long as you have done both personality quizzes, I think you just need to wait till the applications close to get the next update on the apps. (unless someone has been updated after completing stage 3). I think the usual process is: if stage 2 is a pass -> receive stage 3 invitation within 24/48 hours -> wait until apps closed to receive an update on the app. Not completely sure, just what I think."

They conduct interviews for more than just AIHW; I believe they do it for “Australian public services” (APS) as a whole. Hence, there are 4 weeks of APS interviews left. The AIHW interviews will be finishing up within the next fortnight like they told me by email. So AIHW isn’t going to be telling outcomes as interviews are being conducted. Based off of previous AIHW and APS threads, I assume our interview answers get sent to various AIHW departments and we get ranked by the department heads and then “match” into one. In 2022-23 there were 45 people interviews by AIHW and a >50% recruitment rate that year so I’d assume anyone interviewed has a solid chance for offers. Did you apply for any other grad roles?

Hi everyone! We have opened applications today for our next intakes of interns and graduates across Australia and New Zealand. We have approximately 50 roles in our graduate program across a number of streams (Insurance, Data Science/Analytics, Technology, Underwriting, HR, Finance, Risk, etc.). These roles are spread across Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth & Auckland, and you can find out what locations each stream is considering on our graduate ads. The 2026 graduate program will commence at the end of January, and you must have graduated in the past two years or be finished studying by the time the program commences to be eligible. Our intern program is predominantly in our Technology stream, and we have approximately 30 placements across Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. The internship commences late November and runs through to February with two weeks off over Christmas (10 weeks total). This is a paid internship, and you must be penultimate year of university to be eligible. If you do have any questions, we're happy to answer what we can and will try our best to regularly monitor this thread. More information about the roles and how to apply are on our website now at www.suncorpgroup.com.au/careers/graduates"

What was asked in the activity was pretty straightforward. But having to read the facts and law and write all the issues they wanted me to address was not easy. Also add the fact that there is no spell check (the first screen warned if you change windows the assessment would freeze, so can't type in word) and the timer is invisible because the text box needs scrolling the timer off view. Scrolling back and forth to timer adds a few seconds because of the amount of text you have to scroll past. And the text box only shows 2 lines at a time. But at least you can copy from the facts/law and paste it if you have to."

Question: Does anyone know of people who were merit pooled but not matched? Or rough percentages? Edit: may have answered my question. Data stream says ‘Last year, more than 200 candidates out of 500 who made it to the merit pool did not receive any job offers’. The HR person on the thread said similar proportions are seen across streams. I think it would be in one’s best interests to keep applying elsewhere, just in case."

Took me a bit to warm up but had good flow by the time the time was up. I'm hoping that speed wasn't a factor in their assessment of the responses. The task, like with Services Australia, is much better than the typical OA because it actually gives you an idea of what you might do in the Department if successful. Obviously the graduate program is for more than just the Department of Industry, but they're the ones running it so it makes sense. Overall a decent assessment of how one would respond in the workplace, I think."

In the coming weeks, business areas within the AFP will begin contacting candidates to discuss potential roles within the Graduate Program. Based on those discussions, formal offers will be issued. However, I believe that more candidates have been placed in the merit pool than there are immediate graduate positions available (I think it is something like 30 positions available). So while being in the merit pool is a strong outcome, it doesn’t guarantee an offer. If you don’t receive a graduate offer, your details remain in the merit pool for 12 months. During that time, other AFP business areas (e.g. those outside the Graduate Program) can access your application and assessment results. If your experience aligns with a vacancy they’re trying to fill, they may reach out to discuss the opportunity and potentially offer you a role. Hope that makes sense :)"

Those who rank the highest get invited straight away, while people in the middle are placed on a waitlist. If someone declines their AC invite, waitlisted candidates might be contacted. So if you haven’t received a rejection email yet, there’s still hope!

I also did not go into enough depth for the R in STAR for several questions. The recruiter told me that only 20/64 candidates will receive an offer for Engineering in Sydney. I have also heard from someone else that only 12/32 will receive an offer for Cyber in Sydney. Up until now I’ve always been under the impression that AC pass rates were very high, but I suppose things are different this year. It sounds like the 2026 grad intake will be much smaller than 2025’s."

ANZ has completely cut off its tech graduate intake as it is shifting tech operations to India, only recruiting graduates for client-facing roles. NAB and Westpac seem even less inclined to invest directly in graduates, opting instead to prioritise offering return opportunities to interns, leaving fewer headcount to graduates. Tough market, getting rejected doesn’t mean you aren’t good enough. It’s chaos and becoming somewhat a game of luck."

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is managing the recruitment of data graduates on behalf of the Australian Government. So far, around 40 Australian Government and Commonwealth departments and agencies are participating in this program. This means applicants only need to submit one job application to have access to work in lots of different agencies. Some data roles we will be recruiting for include Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Mathematician/Statisticians, Data Engineers, Data Managers and Geospatial Specialists. Applications for the 2026 intake will open on 3 March 2025. Last year, we placed about 270 graduates across about 40 Government agencies, including the ABS. To be eligible to be a 2026 Australian Government Data Graduate you must: • be an Australian Citizen when you apply • will or have completed at least an Australian Qualifications Framework Level 7 qualification (a Bachelor degree) or higher equivalent by 31 December 2025 • your most recent eligible qualification has or will be completed between 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2025. If you have any questions about the recruitment process, you can post on this thread or contact the ABS Graduate Recruitment Team directly at recruitment@abs.gov.au . More information will be posted as it becomes available. Bec – ABS Graduate Recruitment Manager"

Hi @Downing Street 191 No, using your HR manager as your reference would not affect your application negatively. Ideally, you will nominate a work-related referee, that is, someone that you’ve reported to in a work environment. If you don’t have a work-related referee, you can contact a senior person from your university, for example a supervisor or university lecturer. Even if you are only able to get a reference from a HR manager, we would still encourage you to apply. Bec – ABS Graduate Recruitment Manager"

Hi @Absolute-Data, the Graduate Certificate in Business Administration that you completed this month is eligible, as it’s an AQF level 8. Contact the ABS Recruitment team directly to talk about what to enter in the major field. @ sosmi12, it’s completely up to you to decide if you would like to apply for a position with other agencies. If unsure, have a read over the position being offered. Often, the agency will identify if they are hiring candidates from the Data Stream or another skillset. They may be participating in this program, rather than (or sometimes as well as) recruiting for roles specifically themselves. Bec – ABS Graduate Recruitment Manager"

Last year, more than 200 candidates out of 500 who made it to the merit pool did not receive any job offers. It is in your best interest to apply as many departments as possible. Also apply for other streams such as STEM stream if possible. Please do not believe if anyone says ""In previous years every candidate in the merit pool received at least one offer"". That was not true for last year. My big advice would be not to choose ""Mathematician/Statistician stream"". Many ended up not getting an offer, if they did, it was under generalist stream. With upcoming federal election and Talk of american style DOGE, the uncertainty in the number of jobs will be higher. Goodluck."

Start by visiting the ABS careers site. You can then navigate to 'Current vacancies' in the left side menu or by scrolling down. Doing so will bring you to the current jobs list. Looking top right, you should see the login button alongside the 'Help' button. Log in and the profile button should appear where the login button once was. Hope it all goes smoothly for everyone doing the assessment over the coming week and best of luck to everybody! P.S. I would normally provide a direct link but I am unsure of the security requirements of this forum :)"

Then offers will be in rounds. The goal is to match the grads that suit each agency best, so I don't think it's a first come first served type thing. I applied and was matched for last year's program but due to personal circumstances I had to pull out and am reapplying this year. So unless its changed since then, this should be mostly accurate.

Hi, @Jyudie, please email us via recruitment@abs.gov.au to discuss. @starapple, please nominate a work-related referee, such as a supervisor, manager, or someone you’ve reported to in a professional setting. Ideally you would have worked with your referee within the last 2 years so they can easily recount their experience. @dduc, a written reference could be typed or hand-written, either is fine. @leitpg, candidates are not scored lower based on their graduation date or if they have been in a merit pool prior (this process is completely independent of last year's selection process). @avgconsultant, generally we do not conduct phone interviews with references. However we may contact your referee directly if further clarification is needed. @Tiv44, no the eligibility criteria requires graduates to have completed their degree by 31 December. Contact us at recruitment@abs.gov.au to discuss your situation further. The Q&A Hub has been updated with our FAQs so please take a look there for further information.

If in merit pool and I exit with postgrad diploma (AQF-8) rather than the Master’s will there be any implications if matched with a grad offer? Just wanted to cover all bases before coming to a decision on whether to accept the contract and hence shorten my Masters or not."

Good morning, to wrap up the recent questions; @stanaespa, candidates have been rated suitable for the merit pool. Now it's up to agencies to decide who they offer a position to. The FAQ document released provides more info about the Placements Stage. @Random_user, only select a location if you are willing to accept an offer and live there. @Orangefarmer, the number of available positions is still sitting at about 220, but this may fluctuate. There are about 320 people in the merit pool. With the salaries, each agency has it's own process. On “commencement” means when a candidate starts with the agency. On “advancement” may mean when the candidate successfully completes their development program and passes probation. But you can contact the agency to confirm what their criteria are. @hav0c, Services Australia is participating in this program which means they will engage candidates from the Data Stream. If they are running their own graduate process then that is separate and we have no information about that. We can only provide information on the Data Stream. I encourage you to give them a call to talk about your options. @troja5, in the preference form candidates are asked if they consent to us sharing their information with other agencies outside of their Top 3 for consideration for a job offer. This could be because agencies are seeking someone with a specific qualification or location preference for example. @hav0c, that’s correct, the merit pool is unranked. Each agency determines who to offer to to meet their needs. They may look at the candidate agency and location preferences, their qualifications, performance in the selection process, reference etc. @rephrasing, to clarify, currently there are 33 different agencies, not streams. We are not releasing info about how many positions per agency. Bec – ABS Graduate Recruitment Manager"

Hi all, To answer some of the recent questions (that haven't already been answered): @user1909 – There are multiple rounds of offers so if you don't receive an offer immediately, you will still be in the merit pool and could receive an offer later in the year. @potato66066 – Potentially the number of roles could decrease (or increase), this is dependent on each agencies demand. @data_downunder – The Agency Guide is a summary of key information and should help to inform your decisions. If you have particular questions about one of the agencies, feel free to contact them directly. Preferences are due on Wednesday and if you do not submit your preferences by the due date, we will be unable to consider you in Round One. @Random_user – Rotations are a key component of some graduate program to provide graduates with further networking opportunities and expand their skills in other areas within the business. For some candidates, having rotations is a selling point but this is personal preference. @Arielxx – Please refer to our FAQs for answers to your first questions. If you would like to change your preferences due to a change in circumstances, please contact our team. @araa – An unofficial university transcript is sufficient while you have not completed your degree. The email refers to commencement procedures so the transcript is only required once you have been made an offer and started onboarding with your agency, a transcript is not required at the preference stage. @Hmbased – Candidate preferences will not be collected again, so keep this in mind when submitting. As previously mentioned, we are not releasing info about how many positions per agency. @Random_user – Most agencies offer some relocation support however what this includes varies. @leitpg – Each agency has it's own pre-engagement checks, so please contact the agency directly if you have questions about their process.

They advertise the second highest advancement salary (behind National Indigenous Australians Agency) so I imagine lots of competition for that role. Thanks for asking for these, and I imagine other tiny agencies ( National Health Funding Body has less than 100 employees, and Australian Institute of Family Studies has less than 250) will take just 1-2 grads. There was going belief around here that services aus was taking a large grad pool – maybe theyll take most of theirs from their own grad program or other streams? The departments with the largest current headcount are Defence, ATO, Home Affairs, and Services Australia. So I guess the first three will take more than Services... but with 220 roles and 33 agencies probably not much more."

There is no reason for the agencies to tell the ABS they want a certain number and then tell you another number when you email them. My advice is not to worry about whether the 220 is actually 220 or not, because it's just going to stress you out more if you keep thinking about it. Nothing is really going to change at either conclusion because, at the end of the day, you either get an offer or don't get an offer at the end of this."

Hi all, We understand that submitting preferences is a lot to think about. I can confirm that at the moment there is demand for 220 Data Graduates across all our participating agencies and this is based on information provided by each agency. @leitpg – No, candidate preferences will not be collected again. If your top three agencies fill their positions in Round 1, we will send candidates to other agencies for consideration. @crazychu – Many agencies (such as NDIA) are flexible so they are open to taking on graduates across a number of locations. For example, if their preferred candidate is based in Melbourne, they may offer them a Melbourne role and if another candidate is based in Perth, then they may make them an offer in Perth. Advertising multiple locations does not mean they have a role in each location. @data_downunder – Yes candidates may be considered by other agencies from the first round. @juliett-foxtrot – Offers in Round 1 may come from your Top 3 preferred agencies or another agency if you gave permission in your preferences form. @leitpg – This question has been answered previously. The demand of 220 is for the AGGP Data Stream, we do not recruit for other agencies outside of the AGGP. Bec – Graduate Recruitment Manager"

I am in the Mathematician/Statistician stream and noticed most offers mentioned here today seem to be for Generalist or Data Scientist roles. I am just wondering: - Have any agencies made offers yet for the Mathematician/Statistician stream? Was this stream considered in this round? And - Any general update on where things are at for the Mathematician/Statistician candidates? I also do see that the proportion of candidates in the Mathematician/Statistician stream is only 5%, so I would assume that there are less of Math/Stat positions to fill. In the case that I am not offered a role within my stream, could I be considered for the Generalist or Data Scientist stream? Appreciate your help!"

I was in your situation as well but I got my only offer through generalist stream. I was not offered any job through Mathematician/Statistician stream. I believe, you are asking this question a bit late. You should have asked before the first round. Agencies consider Mathematician/Statistician stream for a generalist stream but not vice versa. Sorry, to break the bad news. The competition for Mathematician/Statistician stream is very high, you are probably competing against candidates with Phd's.

That means the conversations here—while helpful—don’t always reflect the full picture. So let me clarify. More than 30 agencies made offers in Round 1, across all three streams (Generalist/Scientist/Mathematician/Statistician), and in nearly all locations. - As mentioned by sesame16, and by us throughout the recruitment process, the majority of roles are for the Generalist stream, followed by Scientists, and then Mathematicians/Statisticians. - If you didn’t receive an offer in Round 1, you’re still in the running. You’ll move into Round 2, which we expect to begin around 28 August. At this stage, we anticipate most Round 2 offers will be made around the same time, but that could change and we’ll share more details closer to that date. - It’s still too early to confirm whether any new agencies will participate in later rounds, but we’ll keep you updated as we know more. Finally, if you have specific questions about your individual situation, the best way to get accurate information is to contact us directly. We’re happy to help. Thanks again for your patience and engagement— we know it can be a bit of a waiting game, and we really do appreciate your interest and the way you’ve been engaging with the process.

The percentage of people received offer in round 1 2. How many people are still in the merit pool & how many positions are remaining (Last year, after round 1 position has been decreased by 250, but the MP only decreased by 200, which looks fishy) 3.

Do other agencies consider all candidates regardless of streams, or are certain agencies only considering specific streams without it being stated in the agency guide? I know most roles are for generalist stream, but am wondering if other streams get equal opportunity to be considered for generalist roles when the agency page does not specify between general/specialist/math/stat?"

Hi all, Thought I'd post here that the 2026 ACCC graduate program is now open. Being a recent graduate myself, I can tell you this is an excellent opportunity to start and progress your career in your chosen degree. The work environment is very diverse and inclusive. No matter what your degree is, there is such a large variety of work and different branches in the workplace, that you can choose your pathway once you're in the program. Also, there is a new Digital/Data stream that started last year for the IT/Computer science students that may want to apply. This is highly regarded as one of the best APS grad programs you can get into. It's a very rewarding program, if you have any questions, feel free to message me and I'll do my best to answer. Apply here: https://accc.bigredsky. com/page.php?pageID=160&wind owUID=0&AdvertID=847982"

Not sure I understand how they can brush that off as nothing. As someone else in the thread pointed out the problems weren’t actually that difficult with the use of a calculator, and people who used that would have had significantly more time left over than someone trying to do that on paper. That’s not nothing and is a significant advantage no matter how you try and spin it because a few people struggled to finish on time based on what’s in the thread. And as for “In assessing the results, no consideration was given to whether a candidate used a calculator or pen and paper”?? Cool, so why would you make no calculators an express requirement to begin with if you werent going to give that any consideration? Quite a few of us just ended up doing this on hard mode for nothing. The problem is the unclear instruction for this combined with no feedback makes it very unclear on what basis we were rejected.

I used a calculator (not with malicious intent, I genuinely had no idea we couldn't, and you could see me using one in the video), and felt incredibly confident with my answers, I'm sure I would've gotten a 20/20 in Numerical Reasoning so not progressing just felt like a huge waste of my time??

However, I wasn't invited to an ac at the time. On the second day after the AC began, the HR team called me, saying my background and CV were a great fit, and they wanted to schedule an interview with the manager. This meant I didn’t go through the usual AC group activity, and the entire recruitment process has been somewhat different from the regular GP process. According to RSM's official website, most GP activities start in February, but some begin in July. The start date of the one I applied for on GradConnection was approximately July 1.I saw posts from candidates who had already received RSM's oc. They mentioned HR asked whether they preferred to start in July or next February. For personal reasons, I would prefer to start next February. The earliest I could start would be September/October of this year, but it’s likely the options are between July this year and February next year. Next week, I have a one-on-one interview with the head of this department. I suspect they might also ask me about my preferred start date during this meeting. The head previously mentioned wanting to expand the team from 14 members to 18 members by the end of the year. Do you think I should politely mention the possibility of starting in February? I'm concerned they might view it as a red flag."

But I get how frustrating it can be when it’s not clear what they’re looking for, especially since we don’t get structured feedback. You could try tailoring your answers next time based on what you think the department wants but that’s not always genuine or a guarantee. At the end of the day, the right fit goes both ways. You should put your details on the temporary employment register on the careers page. The graduate program might be the most competitive pathway into the department but it’s far from the only pathway. People get in through all sorts of side doors; secondments, temp contracts etc. If you're serious about DFAT, staying engaged with international affairs, sharpening your strategic thinking, and applying through multiple avenues will always work in your favour :)"

What gives you that impression? I don’t actually know but logically it wouldn’t make much sense to extend a referee request to everyone after 5 weeks since the AC. The email does say no selection decisions have been made and it’s just needed for the rest of the process so I would think this was the next stage in slimming down the candidate pool before making offers? I could be completely wrong though. Until someone posts they didn’t receive the referee check email, we’ll never really know."

I would highly recommend applying again if you are passionate about working at DFAT. This was not my first attempt and I learned a lot from my previous application which helped me to progress further this time around. From what I’ve heard most people need to apply 2-3 times before they are successful so don’t feel disheartened at all!! In the meantime, I’d highly recommend looking at Austrade’s grad program. It’s open now and allows you to work in international trade/International relations without moving to Canberra. You will also learn skills that are highly relevant to DFAT meaning it provides an excellent launchpad if you do intend to apply for DFAT again!

Looks like everyone gets merit pooled first (they have an internal ranking list of preferred candidates). My estimated guess is merit pool is typically 15-20% higher than final cohort (maybe about 100 and they accept 75-90). This accounts for withdrawals, failed clearances and people who accept other offers (numbers are just guesses but likely similar to other APS department figures). Based on previous years there will be an academic transcript check and then epack for security clearance. As long as nothing damning comes up there, top ranked candidates receives conditional employment offer pending clearance. Once clearance has been completed, successful candidates will receive final employment offer. May be wrong about any of the above details, this is just from searching through every pre-existing forum. Hope this helps!"

Process will likely be in a couple of weeks there will be a first batch of recommendations for employment (conditional offers) for top ranked candidates. Small portion of candidates will receive no offer of employment. These candidates will be kept on the bench in case offers in the first batch of preferred candidates fall through, creating additional openings, hence why merit pool extends 18 months. Alternatively, candidates who are suitable, but not preferred could be offered roles in other APS departments. Security clearance is expensive so they typically only do it for preferred candidates."

Do they contact other candidates first and see if they do any better than the ones who already took the test? Probably it works this way They have a cutoff. if not enough people have reached the cutoff, then they get in touch with candidates who were told they are still being considered. If those candidates perform better, then they get the spot. Otherwise the original candidates who didn’t make the cutoff get the spots – or maybe they don’t and less candidates progress to the next stage (perhaps up to a number) If the above is correct, emails will be sent tomorrow to “still being considered” candidates who will be invited to take the test by Thursday, and on Friday everyone will be informed of whether they’re in or not"
