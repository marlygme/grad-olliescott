Things like being responsive over email, showing reasonable availability (we don’t expect you to clear your schedules by any means but it doesn’t leave a great impression when candidates say their only availability in the next three weeks is 31 July 2025 5:55pm to 6:10pm), and being present and engaged during interactions does make a difference.
While these informal touchpoints typically aren’t deal-breakers on their own, they do form part of the broader impression we provide back to the recruitment team. We’re generally asked to report back on things like attitude, preparedness, and overall enthusiasm. Turning up late to a one-on-one catchup, asking silly questions that could have been Googled beforehand at an information evening, or drinking too much at a networking event and calling a partner a corporate square (just why?!) is going to leave a negative impression, especially when compared to candidates who are making the effort.
That said, life happens, and extenuating circumstances are absolutely understood. For example, I knew someone who had to miss a few sessions after getting their wisdom teeth removed – HR across multiple firms made it abundantly clear they didn’t want them showing up fresh out of surgery. Firms also know that you’ll have competing events – it’s about the overall effort and attitude. So if something comes up, don’t stress, just make sure to communicate clearly and proactively. The main thing is that under no circumstances should you fail to follow up after committing to attend or ghost them hoping it'll go unnoticed. It not only comes across as disrespectful to those who’ve set aside time for you, it gives the impression that you’re unreliable or do not follow through on your word (which is at the end of the day, all we've really got).",2025

I’m definitely not an expert in recruitment but was lucky enough to progress despite weaker grades. It probably depends on how you portrayed your t6 experience – did you take on “substantive” responsibilities in a “substantive” team (used very loosely). E.g., perhaps a paralegal role in the DR team may have given you more exposure to drafting/research than an intern role in one of the technology teams – not saying you don’t learn much in these teams, I’m sure you did and you will, but you’d likely do more research or drafting in the DR team (again, comes down to how you portray your experience).
I’ve also been told other factors may include your ECs (did you have leadership positions or do comps) and whether you demonstrated a genuine interest in the application, sometimes saying “I’m really interested in X” isn’t enough, you’d probably have to mention an ongoing case the firm’s taking, who the partner taking the lead is and why that case is interesting to you.

Yeah it's just really hard to say what it is. Ultimately I already have a good shot at a non law firm role (went in-house post T6) but thought I'd throw my hat in the ring out of curiosity but I suppose my curiosity won't be satisfied given it's hard to say why anyone gets rejected.
I do think there's a liiiitle bit of truth to the ""firms only hire a certain type"" thing in that I don't think I really fit the mould of a typical law firm lawyer so I probably would've bombed an interview anyway but that's super subjective haha It could just be a myriad of other factors like I worked full time, am in my final year not penultimate, only did a single degree not a double, too much exp, not enough exp, not the right exp, chose non-law ECs etc but alas we'll never know!",2025

Sydney Clerkship 2025,https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/thread/3246kzy8,151,effystonem92,posted 2025-Jul-22,"Just a few more thoughts based on my own experience going through the clerkship process and now being on the other side of it:
In general, a law WAM of 75+ tends to put you in a strong position for HSF, Allens, and KWM, and a WAM of 70+ is typically considered competitive for the other firms. That said, these are absolutely not hard cut-offs, just rough guidelines. The perception that being at a Go8 university gives you an edge is outdated (as someone who went to one, this isn’t a cope). Firms are increasingly aware that university choice is often shaped by access and privilege at the high school level, and they don't moderate marks based on your university. A 75 is a 75, regardless of where you studied. For those who don’t believe me, if you stalk previous recent clerk cohorts at the big firms on LinkedIn, you’ll see a really sizeable portion did not study at a Go8.
In terms of work experience, firms generally just want to see that you’ve had some – it doesn’t need to be with a T6 firm or even a legal role. They’re aware that highly sought-after paralegal experience can sometimes come down to nepotism or connections, and they don’t necessarily see it as a marker of pure merit (that is not to say you haven’t worked hard, it’s just something to keep in mind – on LinkedIn, you can see a lot of summer clerks have only worked in hospitality/retail before commencing). In fact, if you already have a T6 paralegal role or are perceived as highly likely to go to the best firms, some firms might choose not to invest time interviewing you (as for partners, they’re forgoing $1,000ph), as they’re trying to protect their yield and conversion rates. Furthermore, you also don’t need to have elite-level extracurriculars like Jessup mooting or Law Journal. For example, I know someone who received multiple top-tier offers whose application centred around their passion as a pole dancing instructor. Firms just want to see some engagement outside of your studies.
Once you've met the basic thresholds – a reasonable WAM, some work experience, and some form of extracurricular involvement – one of the biggest differentiators becomes the quality of your written application. Crafting strong applications are an art in themselves and the writing style is quite specific and can take time to master, so please do not beat yourself up, it’s not a reflection on you or your capabilities or potential. It’s also true that each firm tends to look for a certain type of candidate – not just in terms of qualifications, but personality and “fit”. The best analogy I can offer is that it’s a bit like fraternity or sorority rush – while the process may seem uniform on the surface, each firm has its own distinct culture and tends to gravitate toward a specific “vibe” in candidates eg. one firm I'm thinking of tends to take nerds who are the type to genuinely enjoy talking about constitutional law at lunch, another firm I'm thinking of has a big work hard party hard culture and is quite jock-y in their intake etc.",2025

While she had extensive legal experience at a Mid-tier firm and extra-curricular, she actually received offers from all of the T06 except Allens.
I'm not too sure what recruiters are genuinely looking for, but thinking a firm only accepts a TO8 University (UTS isn't that far behind), is a pretty outdated view, I'm pretty sure Allens in the only firm that cares about that. Firms are trying to be more progressive and inclusive.
My point essentially is don't think firms narrow down applicants based solely on your university or WAM (albeit your WAM is below 70, though I have heard of a clerk getting into B&B with a passing WAM – not sure at all how he made it).",2025

The rigour of the academic process of these universities should not be discounted. Firms are 100% doing better to take into account disadvantage, which is great. However, I think to say that a 75 is a 75 regardless of where you study in a farce.
I do largely agree with the following points, where you study alone will not discount you, however, I do think where you study is part of the consideration process.

However, in practice, I don’t believe this discrepancy plays as significant a role in graduate recruitment outcomes as it may have in the past, even among top-tier firms.
For example, here’s stats from a top tier firm who took in around 50 clerks last year. Less than 50% went to USYD/UNSW – still a sizeable amount, but not the domination that you’d once expect for the Sydney process. Over 30% came from universities like UTS, Macquarie, WSU, Wollongong and others, with the remainder from interstate or international institutions. This trend isn’t isolated to just one firm either – similar data patterns can be seen across other firms as well. Of course, this doesn’t mean your university doesn’t matter at all, but perhaps I oversimplified a bit in that it's moreso that the emphasis on institutional prestige isn’t quite as decisive as it once was.",2025

Haven't done C&C AC, but general advice. Brush up on your affidavit skills, email etiquette and legal language. For any group assessment, do not worry about being talked over and focus on getting your point across. Firms prefer those that are collaborative and open-minded as opposed to those that are dismissive. If it's a negotiation exercise, they are not looking at seeing you 'win' but how collaborative each party is in approaching a solution that is in both clients' interests.
Not sure if that helps, but I hope you got some insight.",2025

What was asked in the activity was pretty straightforward. But having to read the facts and law and write all the issues they wanted me to address was not easy.
Also add the fact that there is no spell check (the first screen warned if you change windows the assessment would freeze, so can't type in word) and the timer is invisible because the text box needs scrolling the timer off view. Scrolling back and forth to timer adds a few seconds because of the amount of text you have to scroll past.  And the text box only shows 2 lines at a time.

The LIV guidelines ( https://www.liv.asn.au/downl oad.aspx?DocumentVersionKey= 31f602a6-4dae-406b-80b7-2c90c530f938 ) say grad offers to clerks can only be made during the priority offer period.

hello. wondering if anyone is aware of the effect of selecting a clerkship location preference. is it likely the case that if you preference one over another then the firm will only consider you for that preference as, on face value, they might assume that you are not likely to commit to a grad role to the 2nd preference?
ummm if its a big six, they normally only let u have one preference for location, the clerk location = ur grad location generally some of them say in their apps that u should only apply to one state, if not, then u can probably apply to diff states to answer ur question tho, i dont think it'll make a difference, they'll presume that u only commit to a grad role in the same location as where u do ur clerkship even if u dont select a location pref. most grads are drawn from the clerkship cohort anyways so unless u ask to move for grad, you'll be at the same place.",2024

I am scared to try for graduate positions given I feel like I don't stand out amongst other candidates given I have 2 years worth of legal assistant experience and, really good grades, a few extracurricular including mooting experience, but that's it.
So I am thinking should I extend my degree for another semester so I can get in more experience before I apply or is that a waste of time. I only have 3 units left.
Also do you think it is impossible to get a graduate position at a top tier without having direct law clerk or paralegal experience? My work as a legal assistant encompasses stuff these roles would do but I don't have the official title and feel that is a flaw.",2025

I wouldn't extend the degree unless you believe that it will somehow help you gain additional experience. As a final year you're unlikely to qualify for clerkships, so I'd only think that extending your degree was worth it if it made you a penultimate student and gave you another crack at summer clerkships this year. I have on occasion seen students add an honours year or something to that effect to do this.

I wouldn't be too worried about this part if you end up choosing not to extent your degree in to next year – it is definitely possible (if slightly tricky). I would make sure to clearly articulate what the legal assistant experience involved to demonstrate that you've been performing the same core tasks if this is the case.
It sounds like your profile itself is fine (and you'll likely get interviews in the grad process). However, if you've missed out on internships having had several interviews the main thing I'd focus on is spending a lot of time on interview prep.",2025

Do not extend your degree. You are hurting yourself financially by doing so and extending is something you need to explain to an employer.
Apply for top tier, mid tier and boutique firms. Take a grad job where you can get it. Just because you start out at XYZ firm does not mean you cannot move to a top tier in due course. Most lawyers leave top tier between 2-5 years PQE. Top tiers then hire from mid tiers and boutiques to fill those roles.
Just because you do not get in on the first go, does not mean you can never work there.",2025

My understanding is that each department that has sent offers so far (unclear if they all have) sent enough to fill all their places.

@midsummer I don't think grades are that important once you get to the merit pool. If it was important, then they would have eliminated you in the first round. You made it to the interview stage means you are a suitable candidate for them.
This is good advice. Your grades will be part of your overall picture, but if you interview well (and you've already made it into the merit pool) they'll fall into the background.
I've worked in the public service, and you'd be amazed at how low the caliber can be, particularly at the highest levels-- I was once line managed in the public service by a guy who didn't finish high school.
This wouldn't be a problem at all if he was a talented under-achiever, but his literacy levels were so low he struggled to compose an email. However, he was good looking, charismatic, and most importantly, had powerful friends. This also kind of explains why government are so dependent on consulting firms such as PwC-- capacity can be shockingly low at the upper levels so they need to pay experts to do their thinking for them.
If you are literate, have a degree and can pass for smart and personable, you're in with a good chance.",2023

Still waiting, obviously nothing I can do now, but just interested in your views.
Grades will not matter if you have been found suitable for a position. If after all the stages (e.g. Assessment Centres/Interviews), you make it in the merit pool, you have a decent shot at being offered a position once the line areas review and select those who have been placed in the pool.",2023

Depends on where the position is located. There may be some teams who are happy to have team members work flexibly interstate, and some which are Canberra based, and you must be physically there.
Most grad programs will ask that you relocate to Canberra, but some of the bigger Departments which have offices/sites in other states (such as Services Australia or Defence) may have the opportunity for people to remain in their home state. If in doubt, talk to the grad team about what options there may be, but be prepared for them to ask you to relocate.",2023

Anyone else feeling a little imposter syndrome from not having enough interviews ://
Well, the very definition of imposter syndrome suggests that such feelings arise ""despite evidence to the contrary"". It's valid to feel negative following rejection, in fact it's a natural human response. However, you've made it this far into a law degree which alone speaks to your skill set and work ethic. Unfortunately this is a competitive process due to a surplus of imminent law grads. Considering this context, rejections are merely an indication that firms have reached capacity and cannot offer you a space, not necessarily that you aren't qualified or aren't suited to the role. Keep your chin up and remember this is not the be all and end all of your career. If it doesn't work out this time around, more opportunities will come your way. This process definitely tests our self-confidence, but if it's any consolation, you're not alone.",2024

Don't be afraid to be yourself in interviews and show personality. Believe it or not firms don't want robots. What they want is hard working people eager to learn who can work well as part of a team. This means it is ok to showcase your interest in everything from sporting teams to ballet to art. I actually secured my grad role at a top tier because I corrected the Partner on when X football team last won a premiership. He told me I was wrong, I asked him if he would bet the graduate position on it and I was correct...
Also (and I know everyone says this) but if you don't get into a top tier for a grad program it does not mean your career is over. I did top tier for the first 10 years of my career (and it was excellent) and have been a Partner at a national for almost a decade. However, I have worked with many people at all levels who did not go the traditional route and still ended up as a Partner in a top tier or other amazing firm. Many others who started at smaller firms have moved to amazing in-house or commercial roles.

KWM is good if you wanna work in Asia in the future, with their connections it is a massive help.

I agree asking that question during the interview is very intrusive. By rejection call, do you mean they were rejecting you, or you rejected them? If the latter, I think asking it is quite commonplace to be honest. Or at least it has been in my experience.",2024

Yeah honestly, I don't get why they would ask that during the interview at all, it's so weird. It's also not exactly a great question either. In my opinion, it's pretty hard to separate a lot of the firms apart from their overall bands (top tier, mid tier etc. but even that is somewhat subjective).

I remember feeling daunted by the process, thinking my grades or experience weren’t enough. It’s easy to self-reject when comparing yourself to others, but don’t let that hold you back.
I applied to 9 firms, received 5 interview offers – 3 from top-tier firms and 2 from mid-tiers – and I received offers from all 5.
For reference, my GPA is 5.4, and I’ve had a year and a half of legal experience. It’s taken me 4 years to complete 3 years of my law degree.
My advice for future applicants is to lean into your strengths, even those outside of law. I have a passion for the arts, and I made sure to highlight that in my applications and interviews. Many firms emphasise being yourself, and if you focus on your strengths, draw from your personal experiences (both good and bad), and highlight what truly inspires you, you will stand out.
I hope this encourages some of you to apply next year. Everyone’s journey is different, and you don’t need to be the “poster law student” to succeed.",2024

Q. What format does the recruitment process take?
A. We start our recruitment process by inviting candidates to our Clerkship Information Evening where we tell you more about life at Jones Day. You'll hear firsthand accounts from our graduates, associates and partners. Following this, there are two rounds of interviews for our Clerkship programs. These can be in-person or online and will both be with two senior lawyers or partners. They will last approximately 30-40 minutes. The interviewers will be assessing candidates against the competencies that are essential to be a successful summer clerk, graduate and solicitor at Jones Day.
Before the interviews, all candidates have the chance to chat with a graduate or junior associate who can answer any questions the candidate may have about life at Jones Day.",2024

I respectfully disagree with what you just said, as it seems to lack consideration for those with an 80+ WAM. While I don't personally have an 80 WAM, I know someone who does. This friend works three days a week as a paralegal, stays late to study, and still maintains an 80+ WAM.
Unfortunately, there's a significant difference between a low 70 and a high 70 WAM. If you have a low 70s WAM, you might only be in the top 50% of your cohort. However, with a 78 or 79 WAM, you’re likely in the top 10%.

The transparency around this process is never great.
The nature of application process, which is heavily concentrated on interview, vs assessment centres means they have to reject large volume of applicants in the first round.
As someone from GO8 and who needs to work and have family responsibilities, the application process is far from great. There are amazing people with high WAMs or people have connections in the firm, I think it is just how the world works. There can never be full equality, however it is just a clerkship, not getting it does not mean your legal career is over. Lmao there are so many other pathways.

My understanding is that if you have made it through to interviews, your WAM/GPA and work experience are good enough to receive an offer. The purpose of the interview would primarily be to assess your soft skills, and well as your aspirations for wanting to work in law and at that specific company. In saying that, the interviewing partner might find applicants with higher WAMs to be more 'impressive' and hence be more inclined to accept them, but that's just me speculating.",2024

I wouldn't think they would be too understanding tbh, unless they were desperate for more numbers (bear in mind though, they usually over-offer, estimating that a certain % will reject them). Of course, if you rejected them due to personal/family circumstances (and this was communicated to them), rather than simply because you wished to clerk at another firm, I presume they would make every effort to accommodate you where possible.",2024

I would also add that graduate programs are not the be all and end all. They are great, but there are plenty of smaller firms who take on graduates and a lot of them don’t really care about your transcript. Tbh what they’re really looking for are people who are team-oriented and good to work with. You can train people how to draft legal docs and run matters, but you can’t train someone to be a respectful and decent human being. Anyone here ever worked with someone who yells and screams, or is unhelpful, or has zero consideration for their team? They are an employer’s nightmare.
To that end – a transcript is not really a good indicator of how successful you will be in your career. So if it doesn’t pan out with any of the graduate programs you’ve applied for, don’t let that dissuade you. Major Weetbix hit the nail on the head: just keep applying for every grad/paralegal role you come across, and you will get there.
Best of luck, and fingers crossed",2023
2024 Law Graduate Program,https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/thread/9xv65r1q,38,almostdone,posted 2023-Apr-21,"Hi midsummer,
Unfortunately rejection is part of the process.
My advise if you are currently not worming in tbe legal sector and are unsuccessful this round is reaching out to smaller law firms and the partners of practice areas you are interested in. I have found this is more successful than competing with the state. There are tons of law firms that do not go through the Law Society's deadlines as well.
I have been rejected plenty of times from clerk/grad roles. It's important to remember that each rejection is a learning opportunity and a reflection of an imperfect system.
It's a marathon not a sprint, there are plenty of alternative ways to become a lawyer outside of getting a grad role in your dream firm.
Hope this is helpful!",2023
