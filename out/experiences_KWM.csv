King & Wood Mallesons,"I also already RSVPd to G+T.
I’m really conflicted because I don’t want to shoot myself in the foot with the opportunity to work at either.
I’m thinking of going to the G+T event first then KWM since it finishes 30 mins after G+T.",posted 2025-Jul-25,https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/thread/3246kzy8,anon03,0.7,False,False,False,high_quality

I know I just have to move on but it's quite hard I've done 2nd rounds last year with two firms but no offer And this year 1st rounds with two firms but all rejected",posted 2024-Aug-14,https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/thread/3qr18x54,ptego,0.85,False,False,False,high_quality

+ does anyone know how much KWM cut between 2nd round and offers since it is not a formal inteview per se
They do not cut many at all. You have a good chance of getting an offer if you make it past their first round",posted 2024-Aug-31,https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/thread/3qr18x54,homehopeful,0.85,False,False,False,high_quality
King & Wood Mallesons,"NRF has sent out emails confirming interview times and who your interview panel is so I doubt they are emailing more people but you never know!
KWM might send more emails today but honestly I don’t know since interviews start on the 26th which is super soon.
Hold out hope and just think there’s still so many more firms to send their interviews yet!! Good luck everyone :)",posted 2024-Aug-21,https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/thread/974pvz5v,2024LawClerk,0.6,False,False,False,high_quality

Has anyone heard form KWM about preferences after the second round interview? I have not, but was wondering if they had sent them out to others
I haven't received anything yet either. It should hopefully be soon though!",posted 2024-Sep-29,https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/thread/974pvz5v,auslaw003,0.7,False,False,False,high_quality
