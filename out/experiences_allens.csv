Allens,"Just a few more thoughts based on my own experience going through the clerkship process and now being on the other side of it:
In general, a law WAM of 75+ tends to put you in a strong position for HSF, Allens, and KWM, and a WAM of 70+ is typically considered competitive for the other firms. That said, these are absolutely not hard cut-offs, just rough guidelines. The perception that being at a Go8 university gives you an edge is outdated (as someone who went to one, this isn’t a cope). Firms are increasingly aware that university choice is often shaped by access and privilege at the high school level, and they don't moderate marks based on your university. A 75 is a 75, regardless of where you studied. For those who don’t believe me, if you stalk previous recent clerk cohorts at the big firms on LinkedIn, you’ll see a really sizeable portion did not study at a Go8.
In terms of work experience, firms generally just want to see that you’ve had some – it doesn’t need to be with a T6 firm or even a legal role. They’re aware that highly sought-after paralegal experience can sometimes come down to nepotism or connections, and they don’t necessarily see it as a marker of pure merit (that is not to say you haven’t worked hard, it’s just something to keep in mind – on LinkedIn, you can see a lot of summer clerks have only worked in hospitality/retail before commencing). In fact, if you already have a T6 paralegal role or are perceived as highly likely to go to the best firms, some firms might choose not to invest time interviewing you (as for partners, they’re forgoing $1,000ph), as they’re trying to protect their yield and conversion rates. Furthermore, you also don’t need to have elite-level extracurriculars like Jessup mooting or Law Journal. For example, I know someone who received multiple top-tier offers whose application centred around their passion as a pole dancing instructor. Firms just want to see some engagement outside of your studies.
Once you've met the basic thresholds – a reasonable WAM, some work experience, and some form of extracurricular involvement – one of the biggest differentiators becomes the quality of your written application. Crafting strong applications are an art in themselves and the writing style is quite specific and can take time to master, so please do not beat yourself up, it’s not a reflection on you or your capabilities or potential. It’s also true that each firm tends to look for a certain type of candidate – not just in terms of qualifications, but personality and “fit”. The best analogy I can offer is that it’s a bit like fraternity or sorority rush – while the process may seem uniform on the surface, each firm has its own distinct culture and tends to gravitate toward a specific “vibe” in candidates eg. one firm I'm thinking of tends to take nerds who are the type to genuinely enjoy talking about constitutional law at lunch, another firm I'm thinking of has a big work hard party hard culture and is quite jock-y in their intake etc.","Just a few more thoughts based on my own experience going through the clerkship process and now being on the other side of it:

Allens,"I honestly do not believe Uni and WAM is everything, especially in 2025 lol. My friend who clerked at KWM last year went to MQ with a WAM of 74. While she had extensive legal experience at a Mid-tier firm and extra-curricular, she actually received offers from all of the T06 except Allens.
I'm not too sure what recruiters are genuinely looking for, but thinking a firm only accepts a TO8 University (UTS isn't that far behind), is a pretty outdated view, I'm pretty sure Allens in the only firm that cares about that. Firms are trying to be more progressive and inclusive.
My point essentially is don't think firms narrow down applicants based solely on your university or WAM (albeit your WAM is below 70, though I have heard of a clerk getting into B&B with a passing WAM – not sure at all how he made it).","I honestly do not believe Uni and WAM is everything, especially in 2025 lol.
