Ashurst,"They will get back earlier than that. Ashurst said 2 august last year but sent out int offers on the 22 of July. 1 august is just the latest possible date. I suspect this week will be the majority of int offers. However, I do think the above is cap due to the fact it's a brand new account with one post, so probs just some troll.","They will get back earlier than that.

Ashurst,"I'm also feeling very anxious, so you're not alone!
I personally only applied to 7 firms and I've heard many people apply for way more (anywhere from 10-15 firms), so I'm not sure if I shot myself in the foot by not giving myself more opportunities. My thought process (and what was told to me by friends who were previous clerks/current graduates) is that you should go for quality over quantity, and that it's difficult to go prepared to 15 interviews/cocktail evenings. But in retrospect, I'm now worried whether I'll get any interview offers at all.
I think interview offers will come out soon though. Ashurst's email says they will contact regarding interviews on 26 August. I haven't seen any concrete dates regarding interviews from any other firms at this point.","I'm also feeling very anxious, so you're not alone!
