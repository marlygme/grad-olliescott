Just really felt the interview was too short to discuss anything really.
Also Clutz generally sends out the offer email before the call on offer day, praying my email inbox won’t fail me.","Thanks! Must be a positive sign, congrats @lawclerk-2024

I had coffee yesterday with the Partner for about an hour and they just spoke about their team a bit more and the activities Clayton Utz does such as soccer teams etc. it was very relaxed. I asked my buddy about it and they said that it’s a new method they are trialling this year for clerks they potentially definitely want. My buddy said that there are 4 categories- clerks they definitely want, potentially want, maybe and no. Not sure how reliable that information is though","I also got this email on Monday from the Partner who interviewed me.

Clutz got more gov work so if you value work life balance, working in the gov sphere would give you a bit more breath in life. However Clutz I believe got the lowest pay and less perks then other.
Then you have Minters, Ashurst.
Corrs and G+T is at the T6 level as well.","The big 3: KWM,HSF,Allens are great firms to choose if you can. Within those, KWM’s Asia connection is good if you want to potentially work in Asia in the future. The other two all got British links and are great firms.
