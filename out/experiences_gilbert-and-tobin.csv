A few years ago, for example, one of the questions was 'What is your most embarrassing moment?'. They tend to include a question like that every year to showcase your personality and see how well you can think on your feet, rather than flogging x4 standard behaviourals. That said, I'm speaking as someone who's no longer directly involved so this may longer be accurate, and unfortunately, you're not likely to get many people offering tips or giving you a heads-up advantage on online forums which is understandable, but hopefully this is somewhat of help.","For G+T VI, IMHO, be ready for at least one of the questions to be a more social or unexpected question, something a bit off the beaten path.

Gilbert + Tobin,"Yeah totally, without fail there were always G+T paralegals who didn't make it through every single year when I was still in uni. That said, the whole process for all the firms can be pretty arbitrary and can be incredibly non-sensical and unfair at times (as I keep reminding my friend who is going through the process this year who reminded me about Whirlpool after all this time). While there might be general rules of thumb, there are always going to be exceptions to the rule, so you just have to try not to drive yourself too crazy reading into it all too much and just know none of it is a genuine reflection on your self-worth or whether you will succeed in commercial law. :)","Yeah totally, without fail there were always G+T paralegals who didn't make it through every single year when I was still in uni.
